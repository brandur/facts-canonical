Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
---------------------------------

* Original draft has a sixth child: Miranda Piker, the straight-laced daughter of a school headmaster. Wonka had developed a candy to fake illness to get kids out of school, and Miranda and her father object. The two are turned into part of the recipe and Wonka says, "We've got to use one or two schoolmasters occasionally or it wouldn't work." Publishers said it was too gruesome for young audiences.
