Tyranny of Small Decisions
==========================

* Situation where a number of decisions, individually small in size and time perspective, cumulatively result in an outcome which is not optimal or desired.
* Issue in market economics which can lead to market failure.
* Applies to environmental degradation, political elections, and health outcomes.
* Classic example is the tragedy of the commons.
* Example is withdrawal of passenger railway services in Ithaca, New York. The railway was the only reliable way in and out of Ithaca. The local airline and bus company skimmed the traffic when conditions were favourable, leaving the trains to fill in when conditions were difficult. Railway service was eventually withdrawn because the collective individual decisions made by travellers did not provide the railway with its needed revenue.
