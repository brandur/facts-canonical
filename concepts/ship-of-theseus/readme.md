Ship of Theseus
===============

* Paradox that raises the question of whether an object which has all its component parts replaced remains fundaementally the same object.
* Named for the Greek legend wherein the Athenians preserve the ship of Theseus and the youth of Athens down to the time of Demetrius Phalereus.  Each time a plan decayed, they put new and stronger in its place.
* Philosopher Thomas Hobbes wondered: what would happen if the original planks were gathered up after they were replaced, and used to build a second ship? Which ship, if either, is the original Ship of Theseus?
* Aristotle's philosophical system presents a solution to the paradox through its 4 causes. The "what-it-is" of a thing is its formal cause, which is the design of a thing, therefore making the Ship of Theseus the same ship.
* Buddhism states that the Ship of Theseus remains so until it ceases to function as the Ship of Theseus.
