Asch Conformity Experiments
---------------------------

* Participant is alone amongst a group of the experimenter's confederates, who are disguised as other participants. A variety of questions about lines were asked, such as which was longer than the other, and which were the same length, etc. Confederates provided answers before the participant, starting with correct answers, but eventually giving incorrect answers.
* Participants provided incorrect answers to a high proportion of of questions (32%). 75% provided at least one incorrect answer.
* With 3 or more confederates present, the tendency to conform is relatively stable.
* Participants were more likely to give a correct answer if even a single confederate among the large group gave one. This seems to indicate the power of a small dissenting minority.

Hanlon's Razor
--------------

* Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.

Heuristic
---------

* Experience-based techniques for problem solving, learning, and discovery.
* Heuristic methods are used to speed up the process of finding a satisfactory solution where an exhaustive search is impractical. Examples of this method include using a rule of thumb, an educated guess, an intuitive judgement, or common sense.
* Greek for "find" or "discover".

Scope Insensitivity
-------------------

* Three groups were asked how much they would pay to save 2,000 / 20,000 / 200,000 migrating birds from drowning in uncovered oil ponds. The groups respectively answered $80, $78, and $88. The scope of the altruistic action had little effect on willingness to pay.
* People visualize "a single exhausted bird, its feathers soaked in black oil, unable to escape". This stimulates some level of emotional arousal that is the same in all cases. No human can visualize 2,000 birds at once, let alone 200,000.
* Usual finding is that _exponential_ increases in scope create _linear_ increases in willingness-to-pay.

Ship of Theseus
---------------

* Paradox that raises the question of whether an object which has all its component parts replaced remains fundaementally the same object.
* Named for the Greek legend wherein the Athenians preserve the ship of Theseus and the youth of Athens down to the time of Demetrius Phalereus.  Each time a plan decayed, they put new and stronger in its place.
* Philosopher Thomas Hobbes wondered: what would happen if the original planks were gathered up after they were replaced, and used to build a second ship? Which ship, if either, is the original Ship of Theseus?
* Aristotle's philosophical system presents a solution to the paradox through its 4 causes. The "what-it-is" of a thing is its formal cause, which is the design of a thing, therefore making the Ship of Theseus the same ship.
* Buddhism states that the Ship of Theseus remains so until it ceases to function as the Ship of Theseus.

Sword of Damocles
-----------------

* Damocles was a courtier in the court of Dionysius II of Syracuse, a fourth century BC tyrant of Syracuse, Italy. Pandering to his king, Damocles exclaimed that he was truly fortunate to be surrounded by such magnificence. Dionysius offered to switch places so that he could experience it firsthand. Damocles sat down in the throne surrounded by every luxury, but Dionysius arranged that a huge sword should hang above the throne, held at the tip only by a single hair of a horse's tail. Damocles finally begged the tyrant that he be allowed to depart.
* Morals: (1) Heavy hangs the head that wears the crown. (2) The value of the sword is not that it falls, but rather, that it hangs. This last moral is very applicable to the theory of MAD.
* John F. Kennedy compared the omnipresent threat of nuclear annihilation to a sword of Damocles hanging over the people of the world.

Tragedy of the Commons
----------------------

* Multiple individuals, acting independently and rationally consulting their own self-interest, will ultimately deplete a shared limited resource even when it is clear that it is not in anyone's long-term interest for this to happen.
* Original example: herders sharing a common parcel of land, on which each is entitled to let their cows graze. It is in each herder's interest to put any cows they acquire onto the land, even if this results in the common being temporarily or permanently damaged. The herder receives all the benefits of the additional cow, while the damage to the common is shared by the entire group.
* Other examples: (1) uncontroller population growth leading to overpopulation, (2) air being polluted by industrial emissions and cars, (3) water pollution and overextraction, (4) forest logging, (5) burning fossil fuelds and resulting climate change, (6) habitat destruction and poaching of animals, (7) overfishing in oceans, (8) radio frequencies, and (9) public restrooms.
* Solutions: (1) regulations that limit the amount of common good available for use by any individual, and (2) convert common good into private property, giving the new owner an incentive to enforce its sustainability.

Tyranny of Small Decisions
--------------------------

* Situation where a number of decisions, individually small in size and time perspective, cumulatively result in an outcome which is not optimal or desired.
* Issue in market economics which can lead to market failure.
* Applies to environmental degradation, political elections, and health outcomes.
* Classic example is the tragedy of the commons.
* Example is withdrawal of passenger railway services in Ithaca, New York. The railway was the only reliable way in and out of Ithaca. The local airline and bus company skimmed the traffic when conditions were favourable, leaving the trains to fill in when conditions were difficult. Railway service was eventually withdrawn because the collective individual decisions made by travellers did not provide the railway with its needed revenue.
