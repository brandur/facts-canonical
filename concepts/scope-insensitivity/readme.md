Scope Insensitivity
===================

* Three groups were asked how much they would pay to save 2,000 / 20,000 / 200,000 migrating birds from drowning in uncovered oil ponds. The groups respectively answered $80, $78, and $88. The scope of the altruistic action had little effect on willingness to pay.
* People visualize "a single exhausted bird, its feathers soaked in black oil, unable to escape". This stimulates some level of emotional arousal that is the same in all cases. No human can visualize 2,000 birds at once, let alone 200,000.
* Usual finding is that _exponential_ increases in scope create _linear_ increases in willingness-to-pay.
