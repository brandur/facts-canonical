Tragedy of the Commons
======================

* Multiple individuals, acting independently and rationally consulting their own self-interest, will ultimately deplete a shared limited resource even when it is clear that it is not in anyone's long-term interest for this to happen.
* Original example: herders sharing a common parcel of land, on which each is entitled to let their cows graze. It is in each herder's interest to put any cows they acquire onto the land, even if this results in the common being temporarily or permanently damaged. The herder receives all the benefits of the additional cow, while the damage to the common is shared by the entire group.
* Other examples: (1) uncontroller population growth leading to overpopulation, (2) air being polluted by industrial emissions and cars, (3) water pollution and overextraction, (4) forest logging, (5) burning fossil fuelds and resulting climate change, (6) habitat destruction and poaching of animals, (7) overfishing in oceans, (8) radio frequencies, and (9) public restrooms.
* Solutions: (1) regulations that limit the amount of common good available for use by any individual, and (2) convert common good into private property, giving the new owner an incentive to enforce its sustainability.
