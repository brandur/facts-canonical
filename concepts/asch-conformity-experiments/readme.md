Asch Conformity Experiments
===========================

* Participant is alone amongst a group of the experimenter's confederates, who are disguised as other participants. A variety of questions about lines were asked, such as which was longer than the other, and which were the same length, etc. Confederates provided answers before the participant, starting with correct answers, but eventually giving incorrect answers.
* Participants provided incorrect answers to a high proportion of of questions (32%). 75% provided at least one incorrect answer.
* With 3 or more confederates present, the tendency to conform is relatively stable.
* Participants were more likely to give a correct answer if even a single confederate among the large group gave one. This seems to indicate the power of a small dissenting minority.
