Graphene
========

* Flat monolayer of carbon atoms tightly packed into a 2D honeycomb lattice; like a molecular chicken-wire one atom thick.
* First explored by theoretical physicist Philip Wallace in 1947 as a starting point to understand the electronic properties of more complex, 3D graphite.
* Not discovered in its fully observable and testable form until 2004.
* Thinnest possible material feasible.
* 200 times stronger than steel.
* Conducts electricity better than any material known to man&mdash;at room temperature.
* _It would take an elephant, balanced on a pencil, to break through a sheet of graphene the thickness of Saran Wrap_.
* Two scientists, Konstantin Novoselow and Andre Geim, were awarded the 2010 Nobel Price in physics for pioneering work in the discovery of graphene, which promises to revolutionize electronics and materials.
* Andre Geim: compare the discovery of graphene to the discovery of polymers 100 years ago.
