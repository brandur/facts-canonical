Sabina Guzzanti
===============

* In July 2008, Sabina Guzzanti, a political satirist, made remarks about how the Pope would go to hell for his treatment of homosexuals. The Pope attempted to have her sent to prison for five years, but relented when the Italian government realized it didn't have a case.
* In 2003, Sabina lampooned Prime Minister Berlusconi, and was she was subsequently sued by Silvio Berlusconi's Mediaset lawyers for "lies and insinuations", demonstrating that satire is not accepted in a media controlled by Berlusconi.
