Arthur Lintgen
==============

* US physician who can recognize classical phonograph records with a naked eye. He claims no extrasensory powers. His ability was verified by James Randi in 1982.
* When seeing a vinyl record, he can recognize the music in a few seconds. Based on the physical construction, grooves, and contours, he can recognize sections where music is loud or quiet, the lengths of each movement, etc. He then cross-references with his extensive knowledge of European classical music.
* Ability limited to classical orchestral music by and after Beethoven. He says instrumental and chamber music create unrecognizable patterns, and that pre-Beethoven orchestral pieces are usually to alike in structure to identify.
