* In 1981 on _That's My Line_, Randi exposed psychic James Hydrick who claimed that he could move things with his mind and demonstrated his ability by apparently turning a page in a telephone book. Randi, who determined that Hydrick was surreptitiously blowing on the book, arranged packaging peanuts on the table in front of the book, preventing Hydrick from demonstrating his abilities as the moving peanuts would have exposed him.
