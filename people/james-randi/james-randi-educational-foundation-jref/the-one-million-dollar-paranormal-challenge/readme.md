The One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge
===========================================

* Prize offered by the JRED of USD$1M to applicants who can demonstrate a supernatural ability under agreed-upon scientific testing criteria.
* Originally $1,000 of Randi's own money, and grown to the current $1M, mostly due to a contribution by Internet pioneer Rick Adams in 1996.
* To claim, one must agree to a protocol for testing, must show likeliness to succeed in a preliminary test with a foundation rep, and finally take a formal test in front of independent witnesses. To date, over 1,000 applications have been filed but the preliminary test has never been passed.
* On _Larry King Live_ in 2001, King asked Sylvia Browne if she would take the challenge and she agreed. She later agreed again on the same show later in the year, but has since refused to be tested.
* On _Larry King Live_ in 2001, Randi challenged Rosemary Altea to undergo the testing. She refused to address the question.
* As an April Fool's prank in 2008 at the MIT Media Lab, Seth Raphael demonstrated his psychic abilities and was awarded the prize.
