James Randi
===========

* Born 1928 in Toronto, James Randi is a Canadian-American stage magician and scientific skeptic best known as a challenger of paranormal claims and pseudoscience.
* Began his career as **The Amazing Randi**, but after retiring age 60, began investigating supernatural claims which he calls "woo-woo".
* Frequent guest on _The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson_, and occasionally on _Penn & Teller: Bullshit!_.
* In Feb 1956, remained in a sealed metal coffin submerged in a hotel swimming pool for 104 min, breaking Houdini's record of 93 min on _The Today Show_.
* In Feb 1975, escaped from a straitjacket while suspended upside-down over Niagara Falls in the winter for Canadian TV show _World of Wizards_.
* Once accused of using "psychic powers" by a professor at the University at Buffalo while duplicating the spoon bending of Uri Geller.
* Publicly challenged Uri Geller in 1972, and revealed him as a fraud in his book _The Truth About Uri Geller_. Geller unsuccessfully sued Randi for $15M in 1991.
* Founding fellow of the Committee for Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP). Resigned from the group after refusing to refrain from commenting on Uri Geller, as requested by by the group.
* In 1981 on _That's My Line_, Randi exposed psychic James Hydrick who claimed that he could move things with his mind and demonstrated his ability by apparently turning a page in a telephone book. Randi, who determined that Hydrick was surreptitiously blowing on the book, arranged packaging peanuts on the table in front of the book, preventing Hydrick from demonstrating his abilities as the moving peanuts would have exposed him. Many years later, Hydrick admitted his fraud.
* Awarded a MacArthur Foundation Genius award in 1986, which he used for a comprehensive expose of faith healers including Peter Popoff, WV Grant, and Ernest Angley.
* In 1988, teamed up with Australia's _60 Minutes_ and perpetuated a fraud of his own, building up publicity for a spirit channeler named Carlos. Media and the public were taken in, and no reporters bothered checking Carlos's fabricated credentials. The hoax was exposed on _60 Minutes_.
