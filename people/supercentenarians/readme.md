Supercentenarians

* Longest-living person ever was French woman Jeanne Calment, who died at age 122 in August 1997. No one since 2000 has come within 5 years of matching her longevity.
* 8 of the last 9 of the "world's oldest" titleholders were 114 when they achieved the distinction. All but 2 died at 114, the remaining 2 died at 115.
* Steve Austad, a professor at the University of Texas Health Science Center, argues that 114 is a statistical artifact. In 2000, he bet fellow gerontologist S. Jay Olshansky $500M that someone born that year would live to be 150.
