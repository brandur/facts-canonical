The Giving Pledge
=================

* An effort to invite the wealthiest individuals and families in the United States to commit to giving the majority of their wealth to philanthropy.
* As of December 2010, 57 billionaries in the US have joined the campaign and pledge to give 50%+ of their wealth to charity. A minimum total of $125B has been promised from the first 40 donors.
* After Buffett committed much of his wealth to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Buffett and Gates discussed the possibility of encouraging other wealthy persons to commit to philanthropy. Meetings with other billoinaires were held in NY in 2009. The campaign was officially announced in June 2010.
