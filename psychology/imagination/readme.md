Imagination
===========

* Shortcoming (1): tendency to fill in and leave out without telling us. College students were asked to imagine how they would feel a few days after their school's football team played against its archrival. Students overestimated the duration of the game's emotional impact because they imagined their team winning (team wins, everyone cheers), but failed to imagine what they would be doing after (go home and study).
* Shortcoming (2): tendency to project the present onto the future. Easily seen when shopping on an empty stomach, or vowing to quit smoking after stubbing out a cigarette.
* Shortcoming (3): failure to recognize that things will look different once they happen&mdash;in particular, that bad things will look a whole lot better. When imagining losing a job, we imagine the painful experience (boss marches into office ...), without also imagining how our psychological immune systems will transform its meaning (opportunity to quit retail sales and follow true calling as sculptor).
* Information from "surrogates" can be used to overcome imagination's shortcomings and make more accurate predictions about the future. Most people don't like to do this.
