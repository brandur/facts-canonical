Imagination
-----------

* Shortcoming (1): tendency to fill in and leave out without telling us. College students were asked to imagine how they would feel a few days after their school's football team played against its archrival. Students overestimated the duration of the game's emotional impact because they imagined their team winning (team wins, everyone cheers), but failed to imagine what they would be doing after (go home and study).
* Shortcoming (2): tendency to project the present onto the future. Easily seen when shopping on an empty stomach, or vowing to quit smoking after stubbing out a cigarette.
* Shortcoming (3): failure to recognize that things will look different once they happen&mdash;in particular, that bad things will look a whole lot better. When imagining losing a job, we imagine the painful experience (boss marches into office ...), without also imagining how our psychological immune systems will transform its meaning (opportunity to quit retail sales and follow true calling as sculptor).
* Information from "surrogates" can be used to overcome imagination's shortcomings and make more accurate predictions about the future. Most people don't like to do this.

McGurk Effect
-------------

* Perceptual phenomenon demonstrating an interaction between hearing and vision in speech perception, suggesting that speech perception is multimodal (involving information from more than one sensory modality).
* Described by Harry McGurk and John MacDonald in 1976.
* Experienced by dubbing a video of one phoneme's production with the sound-recording from another phoneme. Often, the perceived phoneme is a third, intermedia phoneme. e.g. Visual /ga/ combined with audio /ba/ is heard as /da/. BBC showed /ga/ combined with /ba/ being heard as /ga/ (the visual phoneme).
