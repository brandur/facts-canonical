Atheism

** **DO NOT UPDATE CONTENT BELOW THIS LINE** **

Christopher Hitchens
--------------------

* That which can be asserted without evidence, can be dismissed without evidence.

Epicurus
--------

* Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?

Pat Condell
-----------

* [Religion is] like a street thug who calls the police when his victims fight back.

Richard Dawkins
---------------

* Isn't it a remarkable coincidence almost everyone has the same religion as their parents? And it always just happens to be the right religion. Religions run in families. If we'd been brought up in ancient Greece we would all be worshiping Zeus and Apollo. If we had been born Vikings we would be worshiping Wotan and Thor. How does this come about? Through childhood indoctrination.

Stephen Roberts
---------------

* I contend that we are both atheists. I just believe in one fewer god than you do. When you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods, you will understand why I dismiss yours.

William Gascoyne
----------------

* I'm not convinced that faith can move mountains, but I've seen what it can do to skyscrapers.
