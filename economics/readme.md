Productivity paradox
--------------------

* Popularized in an article by Erik Brynjolfsson, which noted the contradiction between the remarkable advances in computer power and the relatively slow growth of productivity at the level of the whole economy, indiviual firms, and many specific applications.
* Sometimes referred to as the **Solow computer paradox** in reference to Robert Solow's 1987 quip, _"You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics."_
* Explanation &mdash; Mismeasurement: the gains are real, but our current measures miss them.
* Explanation &mdash; Redistribution: there are private gains, but they come at the expense of other firms and individuals, leaving little net gain.
* Explanation &mdash; Time lags: the gains take a long time to show up.
* Explanation &mdash; Mismanagement: there are no gains because of the unusual difficulties in managing IT and information itself.
* Explanation &mdash; Computers are not productive because they require time, a scarce complementary human input.
* Explanation &mdash; Computers are productive but they pale into insignificance when compared to the industrial revolution, electrification, and infrastructures (canals and waterways, railroads, highway system).
