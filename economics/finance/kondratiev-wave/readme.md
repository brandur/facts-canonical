Kondratiev Wave
===============

* Sinusoidal-like cycles in the modern capitalist world economy averaging fifty years in length (and ranging ~40-60).
* Consists of alternating periods between high sectoral growth and slow growth.
* Named for Russian economist Nikolai Kondratiev who first brought the concept to international attention in his book _The Major Economic Cycles_ (1925). Kondratiev's conclusions were dislied by Soviet leadership and he was dismissed from his post, sentenced to the Soviet Gulag, and later received the death penalty in 1938.
* Five ways since the industrial revolution and a sixth one to come: the Industrial Revolution (1771), the Age of Steam and Railways (1829), the Age of Steel, Electricity, and Heavy Engineering (1875), the Age of Oil, the Automobile, and Mass Production (1908), and the Age of Information and Telecommunications (1971).
* Some argue that global war is tied to the waves, with a highly-destructive war tending just before an output upswing.
