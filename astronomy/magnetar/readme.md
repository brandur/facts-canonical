========

* 20 km in diameter, but more mass than our Sun.
* Number of active magnetars in the Milky Way ~ 30M.
* Rotate several times a second.
* So dense that a thimble of the same material would weigh 100M tons.
* Type of neutron star with a power magnetic field.
* Strong magnetic fields decay after about 10k years.
* A quake in 2004 on one, gave the equivalent of a dental X-ray to ISS astronauts at a range of 50k lightyears.
