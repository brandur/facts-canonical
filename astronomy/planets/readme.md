Planets
=======

* Solar System's planets are the four rocky terrestrials, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, then the four gas giants, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
* Solar System contains at least five dwarf planets: Pluto, Ceres, Haumea, Makemake, and Eris.
* All eight planets in the Solar System orbit the Sun in the direction that the Sun is rotating, which is counterclockwise when viewed from above the Earth's north pole.
* Six of the eight planets rotate in the same direction that they orbit. The exceptions&mdash;the planets with retrograde rotation&mdash;are Venus and Uranus.

Mars
----

* Described as the "Red Planet", as the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance.
* Orbit of ~687 Earth days.
* Surface area of 0.28 Earths, volume of ~0.15 Earths, and mass of ~0.1 Earths.
* Similar rotational period and seasonal cycles to those of Earth (similar axial tilt to Earth's gives it seasons).
* Smooth Borealis basin in the northern hemisphere covers 40% of the planet and its relatively low crater count indicates that it may be a giant impact feature.
* Geologically and tectonically inactive.
* Other than Earth, is the most likely planet in the Solar System to harbor liquid water, and thus life.
* In 2005, radar data revealed the presence of large quantities of water ice at the poles and at mid-latitudes, the _Phoenix_ lander sampled water ice in 2008.
* Brightness is only surpassed by Jupiter and Venus.
* Two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped, and may be captured asteroids.
* Current hosts three functional orbiting spacecraft: _Mars Odyssey_, _Mars Express_, and the _Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter_.
* Rovers _Spirit_ and _Opportunity_ are on the surface, as well as other inert landers and rovers.
* Thin atmosphere, less than 1% of Earth's surface pressure.
* Surface temperature ranges from -87C during polar winters, to -5C in summers.

Mercury
-------

* Smallest planet in the Solar System.
* Orbit of ~88 Earth days.
* Surface area is ~0.15 Earths, volume is ~0.06 Earths, and mass is ~0.06 Earths.
* Bright when viewed from Earth, but normally lost in the glare of the Sun (angular separation from the Sun is only ~28d).
* Surface temperature ranges from 90 to 700K.
* Has a large iron core, which generates a magnetic field ~1% of Earth's and makes Mercury an exceptionally dense planet.
* First visited by _Mariner 10_, which mapped 45% of the planet's surface from 1974 to 1975. The second is the _MESSENGER_ which mapped a further 30% in 2008. _MESSENGER_ is scheduled to attain orbit in  2011 and map the rest of the planet.
* Recorded observations of Mercury date to first millenium BC. Before the 4th century BC, Greek astronomers believed the planet to be two separate objects: Apollo, only visible at sunrise, and Hermes, only visible at sunset.

Venus
-----

* Orbit of ~225 Earth days.
* Rotates so slowly that its sidereal day is longer than its year, at ~243 Earth days.
* Surface area is ~0.9 Earths, volume is ~0.9 Earths, and mass is ~0.8 Earths.
* After the Moon, it is the brightest natural object in the night sky, bright enought to cast a shadow.
* Never appears far from the Sun when viewed from Earth, with a maximum elongation of 48d.
* Called Earth's "sister planet" due to the similar size, gravity, and bulk composition.
* Covered with a layer of highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid, preventing its surface from behing seen from space in visible light.
* Densest atmosphere of all terrestial planets in the Solar System, consisting mostly of carbon dioxide.
* A younger Venus is believed to have Earth-like oceans, but these evaporated as the temperature rose.
* Surface is a dusty dry desertscape with many slab-like rocks.
* Atmospheric pressure 92 times that of the Earth.
* Surface was finally mapped in detail by Project Magellan in 1990-91.
* Planet has few impact craters, demonstrating that the surface is relatively young, 300-600M years old.
* Has the elliptical orbit closest to circular in the Solar System.
