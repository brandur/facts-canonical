Venus
=====

* Orbit of ~225 Earth days.
* Rotates so slowly that its sidereal day is longer than its year, at ~243 Earth days.
* Surface area is ~0.9 Earths, volume is ~0.9 Earths, and mass is ~0.8 Earths.
* After the Moon, it is the brightest natural object in the night sky, bright enought to cast a shadow.
* Never appears far from the Sun when viewed from Earth, with a maximum elongation of 48d.
* Called Earth's "sister planet" due to the similar size, gravity, and bulk composition.
* Covered with a layer of highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid, preventing its surface from behing seen from space in visible light.
* Densest atmosphere of all terrestial planets in the Solar System, consisting mostly of carbon dioxide.
* A younger Venus is believed to have Earth-like oceans, but these evaporated as the temperature rose.
* Surface is a dusty dry desertscape with many slab-like rocks.
* Atmospheric pressure 92 times that of the Earth.
* Surface was finally mapped in detail by Project Magellan in 1990-91.
* Planet has few impact craters, demonstrating that the surface is relatively young, 300-600M years old.
* Has the elliptical orbit closest to circular in the Solar System.
