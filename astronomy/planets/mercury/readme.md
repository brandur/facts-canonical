Mercury
=======

* Smallest planet in the Solar System.
* Orbit of ~88 Earth days.
* Surface area is ~0.15 Earths, volume is ~0.06 Earths, and mass is ~0.06 Earths.
* Bright when viewed from Earth, but normally lost in the glare of the Sun (angular separation from the Sun is only ~28d).
* Surface temperature ranges from 90 to 700K.
* Has a large iron core, which generates a magnetic field ~1% of Earth's and makes Mercury an exceptionally dense planet.
* First visited by _Mariner 10_, which mapped 45% of the planet's surface from 1974 to 1975. The second is the _MESSENGER_ which mapped a further 30% in 2008. _MESSENGER_ is scheduled to attain orbit in  2011 and map the rest of the planet.
* Recorded observations of Mercury date to first millenium BC. Before the 4th century BC, Greek astronomers believed the planet to be two separate objects: Apollo, only visible at sunrise, and Hermes, only visible at sunset.
