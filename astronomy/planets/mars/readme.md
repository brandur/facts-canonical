Mars
====

* Described as the "Red Planet", as the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance.
* Orbit of ~687 Earth days.
* Surface area of 0.28 Earths, volume of ~0.15 Earths, and mass of ~0.1 Earths.
* Similar rotational period and seasonal cycles to those of Earth (similar axial tilt to Earth's gives it seasons).
* Smooth Borealis basin in the northern hemisphere covers 40% of the planet and its relatively low crater count indicates that it may be a giant impact feature.
* Geologically and tectonically inactive.
* Other than Earth, is the most likely planet in the Solar System to harbor liquid water, and thus life.
* In 2005, radar data revealed the presence of large quantities of water ice at the poles and at mid-latitudes, the _Phoenix_ lander sampled water ice in 2008.
* Brightness is only surpassed by Jupiter and Venus.
* Two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped, and may be captured asteroids.
* Current hosts three functional orbiting spacecraft: _Mars Odyssey_, _Mars Express_, and the _Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter_.
* Rovers _Spirit_ and _Opportunity_ are on the surface, as well as other inert landers and rovers.
* Thin atmosphere, less than 1% of Earth's surface pressure.
* Surface temperature ranges from -87C during polar winters, to -5C in summers.

Olympus Mons
------------

* Stands 27 kilometres high above Mars' surface, about 3 times as tall as Mount Everest.
* Tallest known volcano and mountain in the Solar System.
