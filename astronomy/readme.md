Gliese 581g
-----------

* Sixth member ("G") of Gliese 581's family, which orbit a red dwarf about 20 light-years from Earth.
* Orbits in the system's habitable region, where temperatures would be suitable for liquid water to pool on the planet's surface &mdash; a recipe for life.
* Mass 3 times Earth's.
* Planet is tidally locked to the sun so half the world is always facing the sun and in perpetual light, and the other in darkness (similar to how the Moon is tidally locked to the Earth).

Magnetar
--------

* 20 km in diameter, but more mass than our Sun.
* Number of active magnetars in the Milky Way ~ 30M.
* Rotate several times a second.
* So dense that a thimble of the same material would weigh 100M tons.
* Type of neutron star with a power magnetic field.
* Strong magnetic fields decay after about 10k years.
* A quake in 2004 on one, gave the equivalent of a dental X-ray to ISS astronauts at a range of 50k lightyears.

Planets
-------

* Solar System's planets are the four rocky terrestrials, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, then the four gas giants, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
* Solar System contains at least five dwarf planets: Pluto, Ceres, Haumea, Makemake, and Eris.
* All eight planets in the Solar System orbit the Sun in the direction that the Sun is rotating, which is counterclockwise when viewed from above the Earth's north pole.
* Six of the eight planets rotate in the same direction that they orbit. The exceptions&mdash;the planets with retrograde rotation&mdash;are Venus and Uranus.
