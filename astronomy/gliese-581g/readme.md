Gliese 581g
===========

* Sixth member ("G") of Gliese 581's family, which orbit a red dwarf about 20 light-years from Earth.
* Orbits in the system's habitable region, where temperatures would be suitable for liquid water to pool on the planet's surface &mdash; a recipe for life.
* Mass 3 times Earth's.
* Planet is tidally locked to the sun so half the world is always facing the sun and in perpetual light, and the other in darkness (similar to how the Moon is tidally locked to the Earth).
