Summer of the Shark
===================

* Coverage of shark attacks by American newsmedia in the summer of 2001, beginning following an attack on 8-year-old Jessie Arbogast over the Fourth of the July weekend.
* Coveraged continued unabated from the first attack until the September 11 terrorist attacks&mdash;despite no evidence for an actual increase in attacks. Since been remembered as an example of tabloid television perpetuating a story with no real merit beyond its ability to draw ratings.
