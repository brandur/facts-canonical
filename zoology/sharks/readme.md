Jersey Shore Attacks of 1916
----------------------------

* Series of attacks along the coast of New Jersey between July 1 and July 12, 1916, in which 4 people were killed and 1 injured.
* Occurred during the deadily summer heat wave and polio epidemic in the northeastern US that drove 1000s to the seaside resorts of the Jersey Shore. Scholars believe that the increased presence of sharks and humans in the watr led to the attacks.

Summer of the Shark
-------------------

* Coverage of shark attacks by American newsmedia in the summer of 2001, beginning following an attack on 8-year-old Jessie Arbogast over the Fourth of the July weekend.
* Coveraged continued unabated from the first attack until the September 11 terrorist attacks&mdash;despite no evidence for an actual increase in attacks. Since been remembered as an example of tabloid television perpetuating a story with no real merit beyond its ability to draw ratings.
