Deterministic System
--------------------

* Conceptual model applied to a system for understanding everything that has and will occur in the system, based on the physical outcomes of causality. Every action, or cause, produces a reaction, or effect, and every reaction, it turn, becomes the cause of subsequent reactions. The totality of these cascading events can theoretically show exactly how the system will exist at any moment in time.

Enlightened Self-interest
-------------------------

* Philosophy in ethics which states that persons who act to further the interests of others (or the interests of the group or groups to which they belong) ultimately serve their own self-interest.
* Often simplified that an individual, group, or commercial entity will _do well by doing good_.

Existentialism
--------------

* Applied to the work of a number of 19th- and 20th-century philosophers, who held that the focus of philosophical thought should deal with the conditions of existence of the individual person and his or her emotions, actions, responsibilities, and thoughts.
* Soren Kiekergaard, posthumously regarded as the father of existentialism, maintained that the individual is solely responsible for giving his or her own life meaning and for living that life passionately and sincerely, in spite of many existential obstacles and distractions including despair, angst, absurdity, alienation, and boredom.
* Soren Kierkergaard and Friedrich Nietzsche were both considered fundamental to existentialism, but neither used the term.
