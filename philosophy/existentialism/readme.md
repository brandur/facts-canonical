Existentialism
==============

* Applied to the work of a number of 19th- and 20th-century philosophers, who held that the focus of philosophical thought should deal with the conditions of existence of the individual person and his or her emotions, actions, responsibilities, and thoughts.
* Soren Kiekergaard, posthumously regarded as the father of existentialism, maintained that the individual is solely responsible for giving his or her own life meaning and for living that life passionately and sincerely, in spite of many existential obstacles and distractions including despair, angst, absurdity, alienation, and boredom.
* Soren Kierkergaard and Friedrich Nietzsche were both considered fundamental to existentialism, but neither used the term.
