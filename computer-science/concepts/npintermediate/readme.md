NP-intermediate
===============

* If P &neq; NP then there exists problems in NP that are neither P nor NP-complete, and these are called NP-intermediate. For now, it is not known whether they are P or NP-complete.
* Examples are the graph isomorphism problem, the discrete logarithm problem, and the integer factorization problem.
