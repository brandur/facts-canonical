Name Binding
============

* Association of objects (data/code) with identifiers. An identifier bound to an object is a _reference_ to that object.
* **Static** (or early): bindings performed before a program runs. e.g. A function call in C.
* **Dynamic** (or late, or virtual): bindings performed as the program runs. e.g. _Dynamic dispatch_, as in a virtual method call in C++.
* **Late static**: somewhere between static and dynamic. e.g. A static field reference in PHP can be changed in a class by redefining that field in a derivation of that class.
