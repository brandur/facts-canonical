P Versus NP Problem
===================

* Major unsolved problem in computer science. Informally, it asks whether every problem whose solution can be efficiently checked by a coputer can also be efficiently _solved_ by a computer.
* One of the seven Millenium Prize Problems selected by the Clay Mathematics Institute to carry a US$ 1,000,000 prize for the first correct solution.
* The class of questions for which some algorithm can provide an answer in polynomial time is called P. The class of questions for which an answer can be verified in polynomial time is called NP.
