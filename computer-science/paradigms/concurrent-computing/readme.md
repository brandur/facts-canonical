Concurrent Computing
====================

* Form of computing in which programs are designed as collections of interacting computational processes that _may_ be executed in parallel.
* Communication between concurrent processes can be abstracted (e.g. by using futures), or handled explicitly by (1) shared memory, or (2) message passing.
