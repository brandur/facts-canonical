Concurrent Computing
--------------------

* Form of computing in which programs are designed as collections of interacting computational processes that _may_ be executed in parallel.
* Communication between concurrent processes can be abstracted (e.g. by using futures), or handled explicitly by (1) shared memory, or (2) message passing.

Parallel Computing
------------------

* Form of computation in which many calculations are carried out simultaneously, operating on the principle that large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which are then solved concurrently.
* Several forms: (1) bit-level (increase processor word size), (2) instruction level, (3) data, and (4) task parallelism.
