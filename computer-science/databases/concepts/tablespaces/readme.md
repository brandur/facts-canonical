Tablespaces
===========

* Storage mechanism where database objects can be kept. It provides a layer of abstraction between physical and logical data, and allocates storage for all DBMS managed segments (a segment is an object that occupies physical space like a table or index).
* Using tablespaces, the disk layout of an installation can be controlled. A heavily used index can be placed on a fast SCSI disk while a rarely accessed table could be put on a slow IDE disk.
