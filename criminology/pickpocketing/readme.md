Pickpocketing
=============

* Only pickpockets left working in New York are middle-aged or older, and even those are few. Good thieves in Europe are 22 to 35.
* _Bag workers_ went for purses, _lush workers_ went for unconscious drunks, and _fob workers_ worked trains using only their index and middle fingers to extract coins and paper money.
* Around 1990, there were ~23k reported pickpocketing incidents in New York. By 1995, that had declined by half. Today, the NYPD doesn't even maintain numbers anymore.
* In Europe, pickpocketing still flourishes with professionals from countries like Blugaria and Romania able to travel more freely thanks to their acceptance into the EU in 2007.
