Benford's Law
=============

* Describes a formula that predicts the frequencies of numbers found in many categories of statistics, specifically that given the digits 1-9, the earlier numbers occur with much greater frequency. ![Link](http://www.rexswain.com/benford.html).
* Predicted frequency of the number 1 is 30.1%, and from falls off to 2 at 17.6%, 3 at 12.5%, 4 and 9.7%, etc.
* Can be used to check for fake coin toss charts: the overwhelming odds that at some point in a series of 200 tosses, either heads or tails will come up six or more times in a row (something fakers don't know).
