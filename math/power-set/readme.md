Power Set
=========

* The power set (or powerset) or any set <math>S</math>, written <math>P(S)</math>, <math>â„˜(S)</math> or <math>2^S</math> is the set of all subsets of <math>S</math>, including the empty set and S itself.
* Any subset of <math>P(S)</math> is called a family of sets over <math>S</math>.
* If <math>S</math> is a finite set of <math>|S| = n</math> elements, then the power set of <math>S</math> contains <math>|P(S)| = 2^n</math> elements.
* The power set always has a strictly higher cardinality than the set itself.
