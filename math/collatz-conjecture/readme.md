Collatz Conjecture
==================

* Unsolved conjecture in mathematics named after Lothra Collatz, who proposed it in 1937. The sequence it produces it sometimes referred to as the **hailstone sequence**, or as **wondrous numbers**.
* Take any natural number _n_. If _n_ is even, divide it by 2 to get _n_ / 2, if n is odd multiply it by 3 and add 1 to obtain 3 _n_ + 1. Repeat the process indefinitely, and 1 will always be reached. This property has been called **oneness**.
* Paul Erdos said about the Collatz conjecture: "Mathematics is not yet ready for such problems."
