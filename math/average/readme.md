Average
=======

* An average, or central tendency, of a data set is a measure of the "middle" value of the data set.
* The 3 most common means are the Pythagorean means &mdash; the arithmetic mean, the geometric mean, and the harmonic mean.

Arithmetic Mean
---------------

* Given <math>n</math> numbers, the arithmetic mean (often just called "the mean") is the sum divided by <math>n</math>: <math>AM = \frac{a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_3}{n}</math>.

Geometric Mean
--------------

* The geometric mean of <math>n</math> numbers is obtained by multiplying them and taking the <math>n</math>th root: <math>GM = \sqrt{n}{a_1 a_2 ... a_n}</math>.

Harmonic Mean
-------------

* The harmonic mean for a set of numbers is defined as the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of each <math>a_i</math>: <math>HM = \frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_1} + \frac{1}{a_2} + ... + \frac{1}{a_n}}</math>.
* Useful for calculating average speed and average resistance (the arithmetic mean will provide the wrong values in these cases).

Median
------

* The median is the middle number of the list when it is ranked in order.

Mode
----

* The mode is the most frequently occurring number in a list. It is not necessarily well defined: if two numbers occur with the same frequency then that list may have two modes.
