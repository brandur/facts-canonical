Harmonic Mean
=============

* The harmonic mean for a set of numbers is defined as the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of each <math>a_i</math>: <math>HM = \frac{n}{\frac{1}{a_1} + \frac{1}{a_2} + ... + \frac{1}{a_n}}</math>.
* Useful for calculating average speed and average resistance (the arithmetic mean will provide the wrong values in these cases).
