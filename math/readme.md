Average
-------

* An average, or central tendency, of a data set is a measure of the "middle" value of the data set.
* The 3 most common means are the Pythagorean means &mdash; the arithmetic mean, the geometric mean, and the harmonic mean.

Benford's Law
-------------

* Describes a formula that predicts the frequencies of numbers found in many categories of statistics, specifically that given the digits 1-9, the earlier numbers occur with much greater frequency. ![Link](http://www.rexswain.com/benford.html).
* Predicted frequency of the number 1 is 30.1%, and from falls off to 2 at 17.6%, 3 at 12.5%, 4 and 9.7%, etc.
* Can be used to check for fake coin toss charts: the overwhelming odds that at some point in a series of 200 tosses, either heads or tails will come up six or more times in a row (something fakers don't know).

Collatz Conjecture
------------------

* Unsolved conjecture in mathematics named after Lothra Collatz, who proposed it in 1937. The sequence it produces it sometimes referred to as the **hailstone sequence**, or as **wondrous numbers**.
* Take any natural number _n_. If _n_ is even, divide it by 2 to get _n_ / 2, if n is odd multiply it by 3 and add 1 to obtain 3 _n_ + 1. Repeat the process indefinitely, and 1 will always be reached. This property has been called **oneness**.
* Paul Erdos said about the Collatz conjecture: "Mathematics is not yet ready for such problems."

Power Set
---------

* The power set (or powerset) or any set <math>S</math>, written <math>P(S)</math>, <math>â„˜(S)</math> or <math>2^S</math> is the set of all subsets of <math>S</math>, including the empty set and S itself.
* Any subset of <math>P(S)</math> is called a family of sets over <math>S</math>.
* If <math>S</math> is a finite set of <math>|S| = n</math> elements, then the power set of <math>S</math> contains <math>|P(S)| = 2^n</math> elements.
* The power set always has a strictly higher cardinality than the set itself.
