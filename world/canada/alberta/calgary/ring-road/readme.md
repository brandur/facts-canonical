Ring Road
=========

* Officially known as Highway 201, a name derived from Highway 1 (the Trans-Canada) and Highway 2 (Deerfoot), highways that 201 serves as a bypass for.
* Tsuu Tina voted against selling land for the SW portion of the ring road for an amount that would've equated to $150k per resident. The band wished to continue negotiations, but the province showed little interest.
* Stoney Trail serves as the Northwest and Northeast portion of the ring road.
* Southeast leg will be from 17 Avenue SE to Highway 22X, with a scheduled completion date of 2013.
