Calaca
======

* Figure of a skull or skeleton (usually human) commonly used for decoration during the Mexican Day of the Dead festival.
* Tracing their origins from Aztec imagery, calacas are frequently shown with marigold flowers and foliage.
* Generally depicted as joyous rather than mournful. From the Mexican belief that no dead soul likes to be thought of sadly. This belief goes back to Aztec times, and is one of the few traditions left over after Spanish conquest.
* Manifest as skull masks worn by revelers, small figures made of carved wood or fired clay, or sweet treats in the form of skulls.
* In neighboring Guatemala, calaca is understood as death, and is not depicted as a joyful image.
