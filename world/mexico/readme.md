Calaca
------

* Figure of a skull or skeleton (usually human) commonly used for decoration during the Mexican Day of the Dead festival.
* Tracing their origins from Aztec imagery, calacas are frequently shown with marigold flowers and foliage.
* Generally depicted as joyous rather than mournful. From the Mexican belief that no dead soul likes to be thought of sadly. This belief goes back to Aztec times, and is one of the few traditions left over after Spanish conquest.
* Manifest as skull masks worn by revelers, small figures made of carved wood or fired clay, or sweet treats in the form of skulls.
* In neighboring Guatemala, calaca is understood as death, and is not depicted as a joyful image.

Day of the Dead
---------------

* Day of the Dead (_DÃ­a de los Muertos_) is a Mexican holiday that focuses on gatherings of friends and family to pray for and remember friends and family who have died.
* Takes place on Nov 1 and 2, in connection with the Catholic holidays of All Saints' Day (Nov 1) and All Souls' Day (Nov 2).
* Traditions include building private altars honoring the deceased using sugar skulls, marigolds, and the favorite foods and beverages of the departed, and visiting graves with these as gifts.
* Origins traced to an Aztec festival dedicated to a goddess called Mictecacihuatl, in the ninth month of the Aztech calendar. It began in August and was celebrated for an entire month.
