Eiffel Tower
============

* Built in 1889 and located on the Champ de Mars in Paris.
* Built as the entrance arch to the 1889 World's Fair by engineer Gustave Eiffel.
* Stands at 324m tall (~81 stories), and was the tallest building in the world until the completion of the Chrysler Building in NYC in 1930.
* More dangerous to build than a skyscraper because of its open nature, despite this safety precautions were taken and only one man died during construction.
* Much criticised by the public when built, one famous and often-cited letter condemning it was signed by Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier, Charles Gounod, Charles Garnier, Jean-Leon Gerome, William-Adolphe Bouguereau, and Alexandre Dumas.
* Novelist Guy de Maupassant, who claimed to hate the tower, supposedly ate lunch in the Tower's restaurant every day. When asked why, he answered that it was the one place in Paris where one could not see the structure.
* A Hollywood cliche is that a view from a Parisian window always includes the tower. In reality, zoning restrictions in Paris limit the height of most buildings to 7 stories, and therefore only a handful of taller buildings have a clear view of the tower.
* Originally, ownership was to be passed back to the City of Paris in 1909 and it would be dismantled. Due to its value for communication purposes, it was left standing.
* Con artist Victor Lustig "sold" the tower for scrap metal on two separate occasions in 1925.
* Maintenance of the tower includes applying 50 to 60 tonnes of paint every 7 years to protect it from rust. In order to maintain a uniform apperance to an observer on the ground, 3 separate colours of paint are used on the tower with the darkest at the bottom. Polls are conducted to choose future paint colours.
* Replica in Las Vegas is 1/2 scale (165 m).
