=======================

* Temperatures at 15,000m would have been a projected 300C, at which the drill bit would no longer work.
* Project was stopped when temperatures in the hole turned out to be 180C instead of the expected 100C.
* Scientific drilling project of the former USSR that drilled 12,261m, the deepest hole ever made.
