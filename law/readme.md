Constitutional
--------------

* It's not the Miranda "rights" , it's the Miranda "warning", the rights have always been around in the form of the constitution.

Copyright
---------

* Unlike authors, musicians don't own their own copyright. This is because the industry had music redefined as 'work for hire' under the Satellite Home Viewing Act of 1999.
* Toni Braxton declared bankruptcy in 1998 after selling $188M worth of CDs, because she was being paid less than 35 cents per album.

Habeas corpus
-------------

* Latin meaning "you may have the body" (i.e. the subject person under detention).
* Writ, or legal action, through which a prisoner can be released from unlawful detention.
* Can be sought by the prisoner or by another person coming to his aid.
