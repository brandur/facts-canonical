Lens Speed
==========

* Lens speed refers to the maximum aperture diameter, or minimum f-number, of a lens. A lens with larger maximum aperture is fast because it delivers more light intensity (illuminance) to the focal plane, allowing a faster shutter speed.
* Important in taking pictures in dim light, or with a long telephoto lens.
