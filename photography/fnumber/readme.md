F-number
========

* In optics, the f-number (or focal ratio, f-ratio, f-stop, or relative aperture) expresses the diameter of the entrance pupil in terms of the focal length of the lens.
* <math>N = f/D</math> where `f` is the focal length, and `D` is the diameter of the entrance pupil (dimensionless).
