F-number
--------

* In optics, the f-number (or focal ratio, f-ratio, f-stop, or relative aperture) expresses the diameter of the entrance pupil in terms of the focal length of the lens.
* <math>N = f/D</math> where `f` is the focal length, and `D` is the diameter of the entrance pupil (dimensionless).

Lens Speed
----------

* Lens speed refers to the maximum aperture diameter, or minimum f-number, of a lens. A lens with larger maximum aperture is fast because it delivers more light intensity (illuminance) to the focal plane, allowing a faster shutter speed.
* Important in taking pictures in dim light, or with a long telephoto lens.
