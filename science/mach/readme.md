Mach
====

* Subsonic: M < 1, sonic: M = 1, transonic: 0.8 < M < 1.2, supersonic: 1.2 < M < 5, hypersonic: M > 5
* Speed of sound in dry air: 343 m/s.
* Mach equation where <math>M</math> is Mach number, <math>v_s</math> is the speed of source (relative to medium), and <math>u</math> is the speed of sound in that medium: <math>\ M = \frac {{v_s}}{{u}}</math>
* Speed of an object moving through a fluid substance, divided by the speed of sound in that substance.
* Required speed for low Earth orbit is approx. 7.5 km/s = M 25.4
