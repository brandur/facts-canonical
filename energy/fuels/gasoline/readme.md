Gasoline
========

* Energy density = 34.8 MJ/L, 44.4 MJ/kg
* High octane fuels have lower energy content, but they allow for higher compression ratios (means less space in a cylinder on its combustion stroke) which results in a higher cylinder temperature, bringing greater power levels coupled with less overall pollution because of the greater combustion efficiency.
