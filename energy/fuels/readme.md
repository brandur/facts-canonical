Biodiesel
---------

* Energy density = 33.3-35.7 MJ/L

Butanol
-------

* Energy density = 29.2 MJ/L, 36.6 MJ/kg

Diesel
------

* Energy density = 38.6 MJ/L, 45.4 MJ/kg

Ethanol
-------

* Energy density = 21.2 MJ/L, 26.8 MJ/kg

Gasoline
--------

* Energy density = 34.8 MJ/L, 44.4 MJ/kg
* High octane fuels have lower energy content, but they allow for higher compression ratios (means less space in a cylinder on its combustion stroke) which results in a higher cylinder temperature, bringing greater power levels coupled with less overall pollution because of the greater combustion efficiency.

Hydrogen
--------

* Energy density = 10.1 MJ/L (at 20K), 142 MJ/kg

Jet Fuel
--------

* Energy density = 35.1 MJ/L, 43.8 MJ/kg

Liquified Natural Gas
---------------------

* Energy density = 25.3 MJ/L, ~55 MJ/kg
