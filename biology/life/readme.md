Life
====

* **CHNOPS** &mdash; life on earth uses six elements heavy in its chemistry: carbon, hydrogen, osxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur (CHNOPS). These elements are very close to each other in the periodic table.
* Life uses significant quantities of some ions: sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride, for osmotic balance, but they also play a role in nervous system function and regulation.

Arsenic
-------

* Arsenic can substitute phosphorus in many chemical reactions (it is right below P in the periodic table). This is one reason why arsenic is toxic. It can take P's place in many of the chemical reactions fundamental to life, the glycolytic pathway for basic metabolism for example. However, because it's not identical, it gums up the process, blocking respiration and killing the cell by starving it of ATP.
* Bacteria in Lake Mono in California have adapted to tolerate the presence of high concentrations of arsenic.
