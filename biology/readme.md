Life
----

* **CHNOPS** &mdash; life on earth uses six elements heavy in its chemistry: carbon, hydrogen, osxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur (CHNOPS). These elements are very close to each other in the periodic table.
* Life uses significant quantities of some ions: sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride, for osmotic balance, but they also play a role in nervous system function and regulation.

Yeast
-----

* Eukaryotic micro-organisms classified in the kingdom Fungi. ~1500 species described are estimated to be only 1% of all yeast species.
* Most reproduce asexually by budding, although a few do so by binary fission.
* Yeasts are unicellular, although some species may become multicellular through the formation of a string of connected budding cells.
* Typically measure 3-4 micrometers in diameter, but some yeasts can reach over 40 micrometers.
* Yeast species _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ has been used in baking and fermenting alcoholic beverages for thousands of years.
* Are chemoorganotrophs as they use organic compounds as a source of energy and do not require sunlight to grow.
* Very common in the environment: (1) on skins of fruits and berries (e.g. grapes, apples, or peaches), (2) exudates from plants (e.g. plant saps or cacti), (3) in association with soil and insects, (4) between people's toes as part of their skin flora, (5) in the gut flora of mammals and some insects, (6) or even in deep-sea environments.
