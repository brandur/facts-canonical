Tetanus
=======

* Medical condition characterized by a prolonged contraction of skeletal muscle fibers. Symptoms caused by tetanospasmin, a neurotoxin released by the bacterium _Clostridium tetani_.
* Infection generally occurs through wound contamination and often involves a cut or deep puncture wound.
* As the infection progresses, muscle spasms develop in the jaw ("lockjaw") and elsewhere in the body.
* Infection can be prevented by proper immunization and by post-exposure prophylaxis (i.e. a prophylactic treatment started immediately after exposure to a pathogen).
* Tetanus is often associated with rust, especially rusty nails, but the rust itself does not cause tetanus nor does it contain more _C. tetani_. bacteria. The rough surface of rusty metal merely provides a prime habitat for _C. tetani_ endospore to reside, and the nail affords a means to puncture skin and deliver endospore into the wound.
* Unlike many infectious disease, recovery from naturally acquired tetanus does not usually result in immunity to tetanus due to the extreme potency of the tetanospasmin toxin; even a lethal dose of tetanospasmin is insufficient to provoke an immune response.
