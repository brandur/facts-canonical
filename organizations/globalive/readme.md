* Orascom Telecom Holding, an Egypt based company, owns 65% of equity issued by Globalive and most of the $508M debt.
* After announcing plans to launch a national cellphone network in Canada, they were barred entry by the CRTC, who ruled that the company failed to meet regulatory requirements for Canadian ownership. This decision was overturned by Industry Minister Tony Clement.
* In February 2011, a Federal court reversed Tony Clement's decision to let Globalive enter competition, citing that it isn't controlled by Canadians. Globalive has a 45 day stay in which to file an appeal.
