Hyperforeignism
===============

* Non-standard language form resulting from an unsuccessful attempt to apply the rules of a foreign language to a loan word, or to a word believe to be a loan word, resulting in a word that follows neither the rules of English nor the foreign language.
* e.g. "Habanero" is sometimes spelled with a tilde (_habaerño_), which is not correct. Error probably influenced by the correct pronounciation of another pepper: _jalapeño_.
