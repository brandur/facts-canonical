Language
========

** **DO NOT UPDATE CONTENT BELOW THIS LINE** **

Anecdote
--------

* Short and amusing or interesting story about a real incident or person.

Euphemism
---------

* Substitution for an expression that may offend or suggest something unpleasant to the receiver, using instead an agreeable or less offensive expression, or to make it less troublesome for the speaker.

Hyperforeignism
---------------

* Non-standard language form resulting from an unsuccessful attempt to apply the rules of a foreign language to a loan word, or to a word believe to be a loan word, resulting in a word that follows neither the rules of English nor the foreign language.
* e.g. "Habanero" is sometimes spelled with a tilde (_habaerño_), which is not correct. Error probably influenced by the correct pronounciation of another pepper: _jalapeño_.

Parable
-------

* Succint story, in prose or verse, that illustrates a lesson.
* Differs from a fable in that fables use animals, plants, inanimate objects, and forces of nature as characters, while parables generally feature human characters.
* Type of analogy.

Pejorative
----------

* Words or grammatical forms that connote negativity and express contempt or distaste.
* A term can be regarded as pejorative in some social groups but not in others, e.g. "hacker".
* A term may begin as a pejorative and eventually be adopted as a non-pejorative, e.g. "punk". In historical linguistics, this phenomenon is known as _melioration_, _amelioration_, or semantic change.

Tittle
------

* Dots over the letters 'i' and 'j.'
* Derived from _titulus_, which means _heading_ or _inscription_.
* Date back to the 11th century where tittles were used to differentiate i's and j's from stylized stroke marks.
* Mostly obsolete in English, but necessary in Turkish, where an 'i' with a tittle and one without are different characters.
