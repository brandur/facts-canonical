Tittle
======

* Dots over the letters 'i' and 'j.'
* Derived from _titulus_, which means _heading_ or _inscription_.
* Date back to the 11th century where tittles were used to differentiate i's and j's from stylized stroke marks.
* Mostly obsolete in English, but necessary in Turkish, where an 'i' with a tittle and one without are different characters.
