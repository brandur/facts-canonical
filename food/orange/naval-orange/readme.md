Naval Orange
============

* Mutation from an orange tree in the mid-1800s. Each orange on this tree was found to have a tiny, underdeveloped twin sharing its skin, causing a navel-like formation opposite the stem. The twins were sweeter, and seedless.
* Unable to reproduce naturally. Caretakers amputated some of the original tree's limbs and grafted them onto other citrus trees to produce the desirable fruit. All naval oranges are genetic clones from the original tree.
