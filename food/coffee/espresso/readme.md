Espresso
========

* Concentrated beverage brewed by forcing a small amount of nearly boiling water under pressure through finely ground coffee.
* Compared to other coffee brewing methods, espresso often has a thicker consistency, a higher concentration of suspended solids, and _crema_ (foam).
* Flavours are very concentrated; so espresso is the base for other drinks: latte, cappuccino, macchiato, mocha, and americano.
* More caffeine per unit volume than most beverages, but has a smaller serving size. A 30 mL (1 fl oz) shot of espresso has one third the caffeine as a standard 180 mL (6 fl oz) cup of drip-brewed coffee.
