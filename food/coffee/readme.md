Coffee
======

* A coffee bean is the seed of the coffee plant (the pit inside the red or purple fruit referred to as a cherry). Despite being seeds, they are often called beans because of their resemblance to true beans.
* Fruits (coffee cherries or coffee berries) most commonly contain 2 stones with their flat sides together. A fruit with 1 seed is called a **peaberry**.
* Like brazil nuts and white rice, coffee beans consist mostly of endosperm.
* Important varieties are Arabica: 75-80% of coffee produced worldwide and 0.8-1.4% caffeine, and Robusta: 20% and 1.7-4% caffeine.
* US imports more coffee than any other nation, with the average person consuming 4.09 kg per year.
* Cultivation began in Yemen in ~850 CE. Spread to the rest of Arabia and mentioned in writing ~900 CE. The Yemenites guarded it carefully, but plants were eventually smuggled out to the Dutch. Introduced in Americas ~1723.
* South America responsible for ~45% of total coffee exports.
* Plant averages 5-10 m in height. As it gets older, it branches less and bears more leaves and fruits. Fruit appears at 3-4 years of age, and is produced for 10-20 more years.
* Ripe fruit is almost always handpicked. A tree can have ripe and unripe berries at the same time, so one area of the crop may have to be harvested several times, making harvesting the most labor intensive process of bean production.
* **Wet processing:** flesh of berries is separated, and the beans are soaked in water for ~2 days to remove pulp and residue. Beans are then washed and dried in the sun or with drying machines. Used in Central America and areas in Africa.
* **Dry processing:** twigs and cruft are separated from berries and the fruit is spread out in the sun on cement or brick for 2-3 weeks (turned regularly). Dried pulp is removed from beans afterwards. Cheaper and simpler, used for lower quality beans in Brazil and most of Africa.
* After processing, husks are removed froom beans and roasted, which gives them their brown color.

Americano
---------

* Coffee prepared by adding hot water to espresso. A single or double-shot of espresso combined with 30 - 470 mL (1 - 16 oz) of water.
* In the US, may refer to combining water and espresso in either order, but in a narrower definition it refers to water _to_ espresso, the reverse being known as a long black.
* Name derives its origins from WW2 when American GIs would pour hot water into espresso to approximate the coffee to which they were accustomed.

Cappuccino
----------

* An Italian coffee drink prepared with espresso, hot milk, and steamed-milk foam.
* Name comes from the Capuchin friars, referring to the colour of their habits.
* Espresso is poured into the bottom third of the cup, followed by a similar amount of hot milk, and the top third consists of milk foam which may be decorated with drawings called latte art. Shaved chocolate, raw sugar, cinnamon, or other spices are sprinkled on top.

Espresso
--------

* Concentrated beverage brewed by forcing a small amount of nearly boiling water under pressure through finely ground coffee.
* Compared to other coffee brewing methods, espresso often has a thicker consistency, a higher concentration of suspended solids, and _crema_ (foam).
* Flavours are very concentrated; so espresso is the base for other drinks: latte, cappuccino, macchiato, mocha, and americano.
* More caffeine per unit volume than most beverages, but has a smaller serving size. A 30 mL (1 fl oz) shot of espresso has one third the caffeine as a standard 180 mL (6 fl oz) cup of drip-brewed coffee.

Kopi Luwak
----------

* Also called **civet coffee**. One of the world's most expensive and low-production coffee.
* Made from the beans of coffee berries eaten by the Asian Palm Civet (and other related civets), and passed through its digestive tract (~1.5 days). Civet eats the berries for the fleshy pulp.
* In the civet's stomach proteolytic enzymes seep into the beans, making shorter peptides and more free amino acids. Result is an aromatic and less bitter coffee.
* Produced mainly on the islands of Smuatra, Java, Bali, and Sulawesi in the Indonesian Archipelago, but also in the Philippines, and East Timor.
* USD $100-600/pound. Specialty Vietnamese weasel coffee from wild civets is $3000/pound. Most customers are in Asia--especially Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea.

Latte
-----

* Coffee drink made with espresso and steamed milk.
* Variants replace coffee with another drink base such as chai, mate, or matcha.
* Name derives from the Italian _latte_, meaning milk. What is now called a latte in English-speaking countries is short for _caffelatte_.
* Caffe Mediterraneum in Berkeley claims to have invented the latte, but it was popularized in Seattle in the early 1980s and spread more widely in the early 1990s, when its sudden trendiness made its drinkers a target of scorn.
* Outside Italy, prepared in a 240 mL (8 oz) glass with 1 shot espresso and filled with steamed milk, with a layer of foamed milk ~12 mm thick on top.
* Similar to a cappuccino, the difference being that the cappuccino has a ~20 mm layer of thick milk foam.

Macchiato
---------

* Traditionally, made with a shot of espresso and a small amount of milk added as the "stain". The "stain" later came to refer to foamed milk on top to show the beverage has little milk in it, usually a teaspoon.
* Macchiato simply means 'marked' or 'stained', meaning literally 'espresso stained/marked with milk'.
* Prepared with either steamed hot milk or cold milk. Cold is **macchiato caldo** (marked hot), cold is **macchiato freddo** (marked cold).

Mocha
-----

* Variant of the latte. Typically one third espresso, two thirds steamed milk, and a portion of chocolate added.
* Chocolate is typically cocoa powder, but may also be chocolate syrup. It may be dark or milk chocolate.
* Caffeine content of 370 mg/L (10.9 mg/oz), about 175 mg in a 16 oz glass.
* Mocha also describes a type of coffee bean. Smaller and rounder than most varieties, these beans are from the species _Coffea arabica_, native to Ethiopia and Yemen.
