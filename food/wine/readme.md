Wine
====

* Typically made of fermented grape juice. The natural chemical balance of grapes is such that they can ferment without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, or other nutrients.
* Other fruits such as apples and berries can also be fermented, and the resulting wines are normally named after those fruit (e.g. apple wine or elderberry wine) and are generically known as fruit wine or country wine.
* Barley wine and rice wine (i.e. sake) are made from starch-based materials and resemble beer and spirit more than wine.
* Ginger wine is fortified with brandy.
* Dates back to 6000 BC and is thought to have originated in areas now within the borders of Georgia and Iran.
* First appeared in Europe around 4500 BC in the Balkans and was very common in ancient Greece, Thrace, and Rome.
* Greek god Dionysus and the Roman equivalent Bacchus represented wine.

Fermentation
------------

* The catalyst function that turns grape juice into an alcoholic beverage.
* Yeast interact with sugars in the juice to create ethanol (or ethyl alcohol), and carbon dioxide (a by-product).
* Temperature, speed, and levels of oxygen present are important considerations.
* Carried out in stainless steel tanks (common with many white wines like Riesling), in an open wooden vat, inside a wine barrel, or inside a wine bottle itself (many sparkling wines).
* In the mid-19th century, Louis Pasteur noted the connection between yeast and the process of fermentation in which the yeast act as a catalyst and mediator in the series of reactions converting sugar into alcohol.
* Discovery of the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway by Gustav Embden, Otto Fritz Meyerhof, and Jakub Karol Parnas in the early 20th century contributed more to the understanding of the complex chemical processes involved in the conversion of sugar to alcohol.
