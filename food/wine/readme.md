Wine
====

* Typically made of fermented grape juice. The natural chemical balance of grapes is such that they can ferment without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, or other nutrients.
* Other fruits such as apples and berries can also be fermented, and the resulting wines are normally named after those fruit (e.g. apple wine or elderberry wine) and are generically known as fruit wine or country wine.
* Barley wine and rice wine (i.e. sake) are made from starch-based materials and resemble beer and spirit more than wine.
* Ginger wine is fortified with brandy.
* Dates back to 6000 BC and is thought to have originated in areas now within the borders of Georgia and Iran.
* First appeared in Europe around 4500 BC in the Balkans and was very common in ancient Greece, Thrace, and Rome.
* Greek god Dionysus and the Roman equivalent Bacchus represented wine.
