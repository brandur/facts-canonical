Banana
------

* Hybrid, the pairing of two South Asian wild plant species: _Musa acuminata_ and _Musa balbisiana_, need of which is fit for enjoyable consumption. Spread by human cultivation and agriculture.
* Due to its sterility, is at a serious disadvantage in the arms race between plant and pest.
* Until around 1960, the banana on sale in the developed world belonged to the _Gros Michel_ cultivar. They were sweet, tasty, and didn't spoil too quickly. They were wiped out by a fungal leaf affliction known as Panama disease.
* In the 1950s the Vietnamese Cavendish took over due to its resistance to Panama.
* In the 1970s, the Black Sigatoka was beaten back with enthusiastic applications of pesticide.
* Since 1992 a vigorous, pesticide-tolerant strain of Panama disease has started to wipeout bananas in Southeast Asia. So far it hasn't made the jump to the large commercial plantations in Latin America.
* Bananas are clones, but very occasionally they can be persuaded to produce seeds through a painstaking process of hand pollination. Only 1 fruit in 300 will produce a seed, and of those, only 1 in 3 will have the correct chromosomal configuration to allow germination.
* GM may be the best hope for the banana. In Honduras, researchers have developed a cultivar named 'Goldfinger' through traditional selective breeding methods. It has enjoyed some acceptance in Australia, but doesn't have the Cavendish flavour, and suffers a longer maturation time.

Coffee
------

* A coffee bean is the seed of the coffee plant (the pit inside the red or purple fruit referred to as a cherry). Despite being seeds, they are often called beans because of their resemblance to true beans.
* Fruits (coffee cherries or coffee berries) most commonly contain 2 stones with their flat sides together. A fruit with 1 seed is called a **peaberry**.
* Like brazil nuts and white rice, coffee beans consist mostly of endosperm.
* Important varieties are Arabica: 75-80% of coffee produced worldwide and 0.8-1.4% caffeine, and Robusta: 20% and 1.7-4% caffeine.
* US imports more coffee than any other nation, with the average person consuming 4.09 kg per year.
* Cultivation began in Yemen in ~850 CE. Spread to the rest of Arabia and mentioned in writing ~900 CE. The Yemenites guarded it carefully, but plants were eventually smuggled out to the Dutch. Introduced in Americas ~1723.
* South America responsible for ~45% of total coffee exports.
* Plant averages 5-10 m in height. As it gets older, it branches less and bears more leaves and fruits. Fruit appears at 3-4 years of age, and is produced for 10-20 more years.
* Ripe fruit is almost always handpicked. A tree can have ripe and unripe berries at the same time, so one area of the crop may have to be harvested several times, making harvesting the most labor intensive process of bean production.
* **Wet processing:** flesh of berries is separated, and the beans are soaked in water for ~2 days to remove pulp and residue. Beans are then washed and dried in the sun or with drying machines. Used in Central America and areas in Africa.
* **Dry processing:** twigs and cruft are separated from berries and the fruit is spread out in the sun on cement or brick for 2-3 weeks (turned regularly). Dried pulp is removed from beans afterwards. Cheaper and simpler, used for lower quality beans in Brazil and most of Africa.
* After processing, husks are removed froom beans and roasted, which gives them their brown color.

Wine
----

* Typically made of fermented grape juice. The natural chemical balance of grapes is such that they can ferment without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, or other nutrients.
* Other fruits such as apples and berries can also be fermented, and the resulting wines are normally named after those fruit (e.g. apple wine or elderberry wine) and are generically known as fruit wine or country wine.
* Barley wine and rice wine (i.e. sake) are made from starch-based materials and resemble beer and spirit more than wine.
* Ginger wine is fortified with brandy.
* Dates back to 6000 BC and is thought to have originated in areas now within the borders of Georgia and Iran.
* First appeared in Europe around 4500 BC in the Balkans and was very common in ancient Greece, Thrace, and Rome.
* Greek god Dionysus and the Roman equivalent Bacchus represented wine.
