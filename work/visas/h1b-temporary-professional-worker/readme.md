H-1B (Temporary Professional Worker)
====================================

* _Main procedural step_: send applications to Labor Department and INS first
* _Initial duration of status_: three, then three year extension
* _Total time limit on the category_: six years
* _Processing time_: six-to-ten weeks to approve, then wait for lottery (lottery occurs if the annual H-1 cap for the US is met)
* _Major advantage_: lasts a long time
* _Major disadvantage_: paperwork
* Once a petition is approved, a Canadian beneficiary does _not_ need a passport visa from the US Consulate. This is a major advantage over citizens of other countries.
* Requires that the intent of both the employer and employee be temporary. The position need not be temporary, but the worker's placement in it does.
* An H-1 employee need not maintain a foreign residence.
