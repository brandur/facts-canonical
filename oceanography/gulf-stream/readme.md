Gulf Stream
===========

* The Gulf Stream, together with its north extension towards Europe, the North Atlantic Drift, is a powerful, warm, and swift Atlantic ocean current.
* Originates at the tip of Florida, and follows the eastern coastlines of the US and Newfoundland before crossing the Atlantic.
* The process of western intensification causes it to be a northward accelerating current.
* Midway through the Atlantic it splits, with the northern stream crossing to northern Europe, and the southern stream recirculating off West Africa.
* Powerfully influences the climate of the east coast of North America and the west coast of Europe.
* Potentially a significant source of renewable power generation, transporting 1.4 petawatts of heat (100 times world energy demand).
* Discovered by the Spanish in 1513 and was used to speed return trips to Spain. It was known that "the current was more powerful than the wind."
* In 1768, Benjamin Franklin worked with a whaling captain and various other ship captains to chart the Gulf Stream and give it its current name.
* It was years before the British acknowledged Franklin's work, and once they did, they were able to gain 2 weeks in sailing time.
* Volume of the Gulf Stream dwarfs all rivers that empty into the Atlantic combined (total ~0.6M m^3/s, while the Gulf Stream ranges from 30M to 150M m^3/s).
* Typically 100 km wide and 800-1,200 m deep. Maximum velocity of ~2.5 m/s.
* Temperature contrast along the edge often increases the intensity of cyclones, which requires water temperatures in excess of 26.5C.
