Overton Window
==============

* A "window" that includes the range of policies considered to be politically acceptable in the current climate of public opinion, which a politician can recommend without being considered too extreme to gain or keep office.
* When the window moves or expands, ideas can accordingly become more or less politically acceptable.
* Proponents of policies outside the window seek to persuade or educate the public so the window moves or expands. Opponents of current policies likewise seek to convince people that these should be considered unacceptable.
* Ideas even less acceptable than previous "outer fringe" ideas may be promoted with the intention of making the current fringe ideas acceptable by comparison and moving the window.
