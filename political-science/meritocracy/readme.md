Meritocracy
===========

* System of government wherein appointments are made and responsibilities are assigned based on the "merits" of individuals, namely intelligence, credentials, or education, determined through evaluations and examinations.
* Relatively recent invention, but originates from the works of Confucius, and other Confucian and Legalist philosophers.
* First meritocracy was implemented in the 2nd century BC, by the Han Dynasty, which introduced the world's first civil service exams, evaluating the "merit" of officials.
* The most common form of meritocratic screening found today is the college degree, but this does not constitute a complete meritocratic system.
* In open source, the more a proficient developer contributes towards a project, the more the project necessitates their contribution, and the more senior their informal position becomes. Both the Apache Software Foundation and the Mozilla Foundation officially claim to be meritocracies.
