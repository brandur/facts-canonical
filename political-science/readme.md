Banana Republic
---------------

* Pejorative term denoting a politically unstable country depedent upon limited primary productions (e.g. bananas), and that is ruled by a plutocracy, a small, self-elected wealthy group.
* Exploitation is effected by collusion between the State and favored monopolies, whereby, the derived profits are private property, and the debts incurred are public responsibility.
* In US politics, the term was first used by American writer O. Henry in _Cabbages and Kings_ (1904), a book derived from his 1896-97 residence in Honduras, where he was hiding from US law for bank embezzlement.
* Imbalanced economy reduces national currency to devalued paper-money, making the country ineligible for international development credit.
* Examples of banana republics: Guatemala and Honduras.

Meritocracy
-----------

* System of government wherein appointments are made and responsibilities are assigned based on the "merits" of individuals, namely intelligence, credentials, or education, determined through evaluations and examinations.
* Relatively recent invention, but originates from the works of Confucius, and other Confucian and Legalist philosophers.
* First meritocracy was implemented in the 2nd century BC, by the Han Dynasty, which introduced the world's first civil service exams, evaluating the "merit" of officials.
* The most common form of meritocratic screening found today is the college degree, but this does not constitute a complete meritocratic system.
* In open source, the more a proficient developer contributes towards a project, the more the project necessitates their contribution, and the more senior their informal position becomes. Both the Apache Software Foundation and the Mozilla Foundation officially claim to be meritocracies.

Overton Window
--------------

* A "window" that includes the range of policies considered to be politically acceptable in the current climate of public opinion, which a politician can recommend without being considered too extreme to gain or keep office.
* When the window moves or expands, ideas can accordingly become more or less politically acceptable.
* Proponents of policies outside the window seek to persuade or educate the public so the window moves or expands. Opponents of current policies likewise seek to convince people that these should be considered unacceptable.
* Ideas even less acceptable than previous "outer fringe" ideas may be promoted with the intention of making the current fringe ideas acceptable by comparison and moving the window.
