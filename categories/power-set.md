Power Set
---------

* The power set (or powerset) or any set \( S \), written \( P(S) \), \( â„˜(S) \) or \( 2^S \) is the set of all subsets of \( S \), including the empty set and S itself.
* Any subset of \( P(S) \) is called a family of sets over \( S \).
* If \( S \) is a finite set of \( |S| = n \) elements, then the power set of \( S \) contains \( |P(S)| = 2^n \) elements.
* The power set always has a strictly higher cardinality than the set itself.
