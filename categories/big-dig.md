* AKA Central Artery/Tunnel Project (CA/T), was a megaproject in Boston that reroute the Central Artery (Interstate 93) through the heart of the city into a 3.5 mile tunnel.
* Initially planned to include a rail connection between Boston's two major train terminals.
* Planning phase started in 1982; constructed done between 1991 and 2006; and the project concluded on Dec 31, 2007. It was scheduled for completion in 1998.
* Most expensive highway project in the US and plagued by escalating costs, scheduling overruns, leaks, design flaws, poor execution, criminal arrests, and one death. Estimated to costs $6B (2006 dollars), it was completed at $14.6B, and the Boston Globe esimated that the ultimate cost of the project will be $22B with interest.
* As the result of deaths and design flaws, the consortium that oversaw the project agreed to pay $407M in restitution, and several smaller companies agreed to pay a combined sum of ~$51M.
* 62% reduction in vehicle hours of travel on I-93, the airport tunnels, and the connection from Storrow Drive. The savings were estimated at $166M value in 2004-2005. However, a 2008 _Boston Globe_ report asserted that travel time for many commuters actually increased due to demand induced by increased road capacity.
