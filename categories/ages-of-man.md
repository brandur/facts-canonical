Ages of Man
-----------

* Stages of human existence on the Earth according to Greek mythology.
* In the **Golden Age**, the only age to fall within the rule of Cronus, humans were said to live _among the gods, and freely mingled with them_. Humans did not have to work to feed themselves, and lived to a very old age but with a youthful appearance.
* In the **Silver Age**, the age that follows the fall of Cronus and the rise of Zeus, humans lived one hundred years but mostly in youth. They were created out of the ash tree by Zeus.
* In the **Bronze Age**, men were hardened and tough, as war was their passion. Their arms, tools, _and_ very homes were forged of bronze, and they were eventually undone by their violent ways.
* In the **Heroic Age**, _men lived with noble demigods and heroes_. It is the only age that improves on the one before it.
* In the **Iron Age**, humans lived in an existence of toil and misery. Babies are born with gray hair, and _the gods will have completely forsaken humanity_.
