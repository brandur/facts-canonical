Kopi Luwak
----------

* Also called **civet coffee**. One of the world's most expensive and low-production coffee.
* Made from the beans of coffee berries eaten by the Asian Palm Civet (and other related civets), and passed through its digestive tract (~1.5 days). Civet eats the berries for the fleshy pulp.
* In the civet's stomach proteolytic enzymes seep into the beans, making shorter peptides and more free amino acids. Result is an aromatic and less bitter coffee.
* Produced mainly on the islands of Smuatra, Java, Bali, and Sulawesi in the Indonesian Archipelago, but also in the Philippines, and East Timor.
* USD $100-600/pound. Specialty Vietnamese weasel coffee from wild civets is $3000/pound. Most customers are in Asia--especially Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea.
