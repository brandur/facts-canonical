Augustus
--------

* Founder of the Roman Empire and its first Emperor, ruling from 27 BC until his death in 14 BC.
* Born into an old, wealthy branch of the plebeian Ocatavii family, in 44 BC Augustus was adopted posthuously by his maternal great-uncle Gaius Julius Caesar following Caesar's assassination.
* Together with Mark Antony and Marcus Lepidus, he formed the Second Triumvirate to defeat the assassins of Caesar. Following their victory at Phillipi, the Triumvirate divide the Roman Republic amongst themselves and ruled as military dictators.
* The Triumvirate was eventually torn apart due to competing ambitions. Lepidus was driven into exile and stripped of his position. Antony commited suicide following his defeat at the Battle of Actium by Augustus in 31 BC.
* After the demise of the Second Triumvirate, Augustus restored the outward facade of the free Republic, with governmental power vested in the Roman Senate, the executive magistrates, and the legislative assemblies. In reality, he retained power as a military dictator. By law, he held a collection of powers for life including supreme military command, and the titles of tribune and censor.
* It took several years to develop the framework that would allow the republican state to be led to his sole rule. He rejected monarchial titles, and instead chose to call himself _Princeps Civitatis_ ("First Citizen"). The resulting framework became known as the Principate, the first phase of the Roman Empire.
* The reign of Augustus initiated an era of relative peace known as the _Pax Romana_ (The Roman Peace). Despite continuous wars or imperial expansion, the Mediterranean world remained at peace for more than two centuries.
* Augustus dramatically enlarged the Empire, annexing egypt, Dalmatia, Pannonia, Noricum, and Raetia, expanded possesions in Africa, expanded into Germania, and completed the conquest of Hispania.
* He secured the Empire with a buffer region of client states, made peace with the Parthian Empire through diplomacy, reformed the tax system, developed a network of roads with an official courier system, established a standing army and the Pratetorian Guard, created official fire-fighting and police services for Rome, and rebuilt much of the city.
* Died at 75 from natural causes, although there were rumors that his wife Livia poisoned him. Succeeded by his adopted son Tiberius.
