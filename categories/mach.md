Mach
----

* Subsonic: \( M \lt 1 \), sonic: \( M = 1 \), transonic: \( 0.8 \lt M \lt 1.2 \), supersonic: \( 1.2 \lt M \lt 5 \), hypersonic: \( M \lt 5 \).
* Speed of sound in dry air: 343 m/s.
* Mach equation where \( M \) is Mach number, \( v_s \) is the speed of source (relative to medium), and \( u \) is the speed of sound in that medium: \( M = \frac {{v_s}}{{u}} \)
* Speed of an object moving through a fluid substance, divided by the speed of sound in that substance.
* Required speed for low Earth orbit is approx. 7.5 km/s = M 25.4
