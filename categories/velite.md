Velite
------

* Poorer citizens in a Roman legion who could not afford to equip themselves properly.
* Acted as skirmishers -- javelin-throwers who would engage the enemy early to harass them and cover movement of the troops behind them. After throwing their javelins, they would retreat through the gaps in between the maniples.
* Occasionally used as scouts when there was a shortage of cavalry.
