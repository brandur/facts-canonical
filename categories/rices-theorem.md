Rice's Theorem
--------------

* States that for any non-trivial property of partial functions, there is no general and effective method to decide whether an algorithm computes a partial function with that property. Functions are _trivial_ if they hold true for all partial computable functions or for none, and an effective decision method is called _general_ if it decides correctly for every algorithm.
* Can be generalized from Turing machines to most programming languages: there exists no automatic method that decides with generality non-trivial questions on the black-box behavior of computer programs.
