NP-complete
-----------

* A decision problem L is NP-complete if it is in the set of NP problems so that any given solution to the problem can be verified in polynomial time.
* Solutions can be verified quickly, but there is no known efficient way to locate a solution in the first place.
* The time required to solve even moderately large versions of many of these problems easily reaches into the billions or trillions of years using any amount of computing power available today.
