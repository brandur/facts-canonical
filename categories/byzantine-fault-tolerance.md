Byzantine Fault Tolerance
-------------------------

* Sub-field of fault tolerance inspired by the Byzantine General's Problem (a generalized version of the Two Generals' Problem).
* Objective is to defend against _Byzantine failures_, in which components of a system fail in arbitrary ways. This is designed to model the real world in which computers and networks may behave in unexpected ways due to hardware failures, network congestion and disconnection, and malicious attacks.
