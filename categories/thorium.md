Thorium
-------

* Lustrous silvery-white metal which is only slightly radioactive. You could carry a lump in your pocket without harm.
* In 1965, Alvin Weinberg and his team built a working reactor that suspended the byproducts of thorium in a molten salt bath. Weinberg stopped research in 1973.
* Dense radioactive element grouped with uranium and plutonium &mdash; members of the family are known as actinides.
* India and China are the world leaders in thorium research. India expects 25% of its energy generation to be nuclear by 2050 (compared to ~9% today), with a part being thorium. China has recently ordered miners to reserve thorium they produce.
* Estimated annual fuel cost for a 1-GW liquid fluoride thorium reactor is $10,000.
