Dazzle
------

* Also known as Razzle Dazzle, or Dazzle painting, was a camouflage scheme used on ships extensively during WWI, and to a lesser extent in WWII. Credited to artist Norman Wilkinson.
* Consisted of a complex pattern of gemoetric shapes in constrating colors, interrupting and intersecting each other. Often included a false bow wave.
* Its purpose was confusion rather than concealment, making it difficult for an enemy to estimate type, size, speed, and heading.
* Disrupted rangefinders: operators would adjust until two half-images lined up into a complete picture. Ships with dazzle looked abnormal even when the halves were aligned.
* Dazzles effectiveness was not certain, the British Admiralty concluded it had no effect on submarine attacks, but boosted crew morale. Civilians also liked having the wonderfully colored ships in dock.
* Used less in WWII as rangefinders became more effective, and radar became more important.
* Some modern uses: in Austria speed traps use dazzle to confuse drives as to the direction the radar is pointing. Car prototypes wear dazzle to hide the curves of the vehicle before it's ready for release.
