Casablanca
----------

* 1942 American romance directed by Michael Curtiz, and starring Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, and Paul Henreid.
* Bogart's character must choose between his love for a woman, and helping her Czech Resistance leader husband escape from Vichy-controller Moroccan city of Casablanca to continue his fight against the Nazis.
* Despite being an A-list film with established stars and writers, no one involved in production expected it to be anything out of the ordinary. It had a solid first run, but would go on to win three Academy Awards including Best Picture and consistently rank near the top of the greatest films of all time.
* The two letters of transit were said to be signed by either Free French General Charles de Gaulle or Vichy General Maxime Weygand depending on the English or French subtitles. Letters signed by either general would have been no benefit.
