Custom of the Sea
-----------------

* A set of customs that are said to be practised by the officers and crew of ships in the open sea, as distinguished from true maritime law.
* The best-known of the customs is the practice of shipwrecked survivors drawing lots to see who would be killed and eaten so that the others might survive.
