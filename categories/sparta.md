Sparta
------

* Prominent city-state in ancient Greece. Emerged as a political entity around 10th century BC, and was the dominant military land power around 650 BC.
* Given its military pre-eminence, was recognized as the overall leader of the combined Greek forces during the Greco-Persian war.
* Principal enemy of Ahtnes during the Peloponnesian War, from which it emerged victorious, but at great cost.
* Defeat by Thebes in the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BC ended Sparta's prominent role in Greece.
* Maintained political indepdence until the Roman conquest of Greece in 146 BC.
* Inhabitants classified as Spartiates (citizens), Mothakes (non-Spartan free men raised as Spartans), Perioikoi (freedmen), and Helots (state-owned serfs).
* Tiered population meant that citizens lost in battle could not easily be replaced, and eventually proved near fatal to the continuance of the state as the helots and non-citizens started to greatly outnumber the citizens.
* Spartan women enjoyed considerably more rights and equality to men than elsewhere in the classical world.
