Binary Tree
-----------

* Tree in which each node has at most 2 child nodes.
* The **depth** of a node is the length of the path from it to root.
* The **height** of a tree is the depth of the deepest node.
* **In-degree** of a node is the number of edges arriving at it, and its **out-degree** is the number of edges leaving it.
* A **full binary tree** (AKA proper binary tree, 2-tree, or strictly binary tree) is a tree in which every node other than the leaves has 2 children.
* A **perfect binary tree** is a full binary tree in which all leaves are at the same depth.
* A **complete binary tree** is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.
* A **balanced binary tree** is one in whichthe height of the 2 subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.
* A **degenerate binary tree** is a tree where for each parent node, there is only one child. Performance-wise, this tree will behave like a linked list.
