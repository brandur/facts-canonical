Banana
------

* Hybrid, the pairing of two South Asian wild plant species: _Musa acuminata_ and _Musa balbisiana_, need of which is fit for enjoyable consumption. Spread by human cultivation and agriculture.
* Due to its sterility, is at a serious disadvantage in the arms race between plant and pest.
* Until around 1960, the banana on sale in the developed world belonged to the _Gros Michel_ cultivar. They were sweet, tasty, and didn't spoil too quickly. They were wiped out by a fungal leaf affliction known as Panama disease.
* In the 1950s the Vietnamese Cavendish took over due to its resistance to Panama.
* In the 1970s, the Black Sigatoka was beaten back with enthusiastic applications of pesticide.
* Since 1992 a vigorous, pesticide-tolerant strain of Panama disease has started to wipeout bananas in Southeast Asia. So far it hasn't made the jump to the large commercial plantations in Latin America.
* Bananas are clones, but very occasionally they can be persuaded to produce seeds through a painstaking process of hand pollination. Only 1 fruit in 300 will produce a seed, and of those, only 1 in 3 will have the correct chromosomal configuration to allow germination.
* GM may be the best hope for the banana. In Honduras, researchers have developed a cultivar named 'Goldfinger' through traditional selective breeding methods. It has enjoyed some acceptance in Australia, but doesn't have the Cavendish flavour, and suffers a longer maturation time.
