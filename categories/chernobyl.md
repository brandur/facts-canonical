Chernobyl
---------

* Chernobyl's reactor No. 4 exploded on April 26, 1986 at 01:23 AM. The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is in Pripyat, Ukraine.
* Worst nuclear power plant accident in history, and is the only level 7 event on the International Nuclear Event Scale to have occurred.
* Occurred during an unauthorized systems test. A sudden power output surge took place, and when an attempt was made to make an emergency shutdown, a more extreme spike in power output occurred which led to the rupture of a reactor vessel and explosions.
* The rupture exposed the graphite moderators to air and they ignited. The resulting fire sent a plume of radioactive fallout into the atmosphere and over an extensive area.
* Approximately 350,000 people have been evacuated and resettled since from Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine. Studies show that 70% of the fallout landed in Belarus.
* Reactors continued to be operated for many years, with the last reactor being closed down in 2000.
* 28 of the 134 emergency workers involved in the accident died almost immediately due to ARS (Acute Radiation Syndrome). Approximately 4,000 deaths are attributable to the accident, most due to increased cancer risk.
* The "exclusion zone", a 48 km radius from the reactor, has been sealed off since the explosion.
* 2,500 employees maintain the remains of the plant, working in shifts to minimize their exposure to radiation.
* Serveral hundred evacuees have returned to their villages despite the government ban.
* Some firms offer tours of the restricted area, but the tours are illegal and safety is not guaranteed.
* A new shell will be built by 2015. The new shelter will be 105 m tall, 260 m wide, 150 m long, weigh 20,000 tons, and will be slid over the old shelter using rail tracks. The new structure will be big enough to house the Notre Dame Cathedral or the Statue of Liberty. Cost expected to be $1.15B.
* Ukraine plans to offer tours of the exclusion zone in 2011.
