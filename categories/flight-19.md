Flight 19
---------

* Designation for 5 TBM Avenger torpedo bombers that disappeared on December 5, 1945.
* 14 lost as well as 13 crew members of a PBM Mariner flying boat that exploded in mid-air while searing for the flight.
* Led by Lieutenant Charles Taylor who had ~2,500 flying hours.
* All aircraft missing clocks because the training scenario was designed to teach dead reckoning principles, amongst which is elapsed time.
* Another instructor, Cox received a transmission from Taylor who indicated that both his compasses were out and the flight was lost. Cox advised him to put the sun on his port wing and fly north up the coast to Fort Lauderdale.
* At least one student seemed to have indicated that the flight should head west to get back to land, apparently they did not due to rigid military discipline.
* Taylor mistakenly believed that islands below him were the Florida Keys, but were likely the Bahamas.
* Taylor was an excellent pilot but known to "fly by the seat of his pants," getting lost several times, and having had to ditch his plane twice in the Pacific and be rescued.
* The pilots were subjects in the movie _Close Encounters of the Third Kind_.
