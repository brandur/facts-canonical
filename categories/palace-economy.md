Palace Economy
--------------

* AKA redistribution economy, is a system of economic organization in which a substantial share of the wealth flows into a centralized administration, and out from there to a general population.
* In ancient palace systems, the producers were typically part of the working capital. They were bound to the palace economy by indissoluble bonds of involuntary servitude or patronage.
