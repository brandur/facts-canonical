Nemi Ships
----------

* Built by Caligula in 1st century AD at Lake Nemi.
* The larger ship was essentially a floating palace, which contained marble, mosaic floors, heating, and plumbing such as baths.
* Recovered in 1929 by draining the lake, but destroyed by fire in 1944 during a WWII bombing run.
* During the Roman empire, the area was used by wealthy Roman citizens for its clean air, uncontaminated water, and cooler temperatures during hot summer months. The lake had its own microclimate and was protected from wind by crater walls.
* Local fisherman had always been aware of the existence of the wrecks, and had explored them and removed small artifacts with grappling hooks.
* Ships were 70 and 73 m long.
