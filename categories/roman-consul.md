Roman Consul
------------

* A consul served in the highest elected poitical office of the Roman Republic.
* Each year, two consuls were elected together, to serve for a one-year term. Each consul had veto power over his colleague, and the officials would alternate each month.
* After the establishment of the Empire, consults became merely a figurative representative of Rome's republican heritage and held little power or authority.
* Originally reserved for patricians according to tradition. Plebeians won the right to stand for supreme office in 367 BC.
* During times of war, the primary qualification for consul was military skill and reputation, but otherwise consulship became the normal endpoint of the _cursus honorum_, the sequence of offices pursued by the ambitious Roman. When Sulla regulated _cursus_, the minimum age of election became 41.
