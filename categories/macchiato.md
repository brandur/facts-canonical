Macchiato
---------

* Traditionally, made with a shot of espresso and a small amount of milk added as the "stain". The "stain" later came to refer to foamed milk on top to show the beverage has little milk in it, usually a teaspoon.
* Macchiato simply means 'marked' or 'stained', meaning literally 'espresso stained/marked with milk'.
* Prepared with either steamed hot milk or cold milk. Cold is **macchiato caldo** (marked hot), cold is **macchiato freddo** (marked cold).
