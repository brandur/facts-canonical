McGurk Effect
-------------

* Perceptual phenomenon demonstrating an interaction between hearing and vision in speech perception, suggesting that speech perception is multimodal (involving information from more than one sensory modality).
* Described by Harry McGurk and John MacDonald in 1976.
* Experienced by dubbing a video of one phoneme's production with the sound-recording from another phoneme. Often, the perceived phoneme is a third, intermedia phoneme. e.g. Visual /ga/ combined with audio /ba/ is heard as /da/. BBC showed /ga/ combined with /ba/ being heard as /ga/ (the visual phoneme).
