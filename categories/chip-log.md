Chip Log
--------

* All nautical instruments designed to measure the speed of a ship through water are known as logs. This is derived from the times when sailors threw a log attached to a rope of the stern of a ship and would count the number of knots that passed through their hands in a given period of time.
* Consists of a wooden board attached to a line (the log-line), which as knots tied in it at uniform spacings.
* Eventually construction standardized: a quarter-circle board with lines tied to each corner and the bottom of the semi circle weighted with lead so that it would orient itself correctly.
* Invention attributed to a Portuguese navigator who designed it at the end of the 15th century or beginning of the 16th.
