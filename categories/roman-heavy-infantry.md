Roman Heavy Infantry
--------------------

* Principal unit of the legion. Composed of citizen legionaries who could afford an iron helmet, shield, armor, and pilum (heavy javelin with ~30 m range).
* After 387 BC, the preferred weapon was the gladius, a short sword.
* Divided pre-Marian into _hastati_ (inexperienced soldiers), _principes_ (men in their primes), and _triarii_ (veteran soldiers, only used in extreme situations).
