Agency Pricing
--------------

* Pricing scheme applied to digital books.
* Five major publishers participate: Simon & Schuster (Pocket), Penguin (Berkley/NAL/Ace), HarperCollins (Avon), HarperCollins (Avon), Hachette (Warner, Orbit), Macmillan (St. Martin's Press, Tor).
* Instituted in US, UK, and Australia (although some argue it's against the law in Australia).
* Publisher controls the price and the retailer is not allowed to discount.
* Publisher gets 70%, and the retailer gets 30%.
* If a book is discounted at a retailer, chances are the publisher isn't participating in agency pricing. Most small press publishers do not: Harlequin, Random House, Kensington.
* Under agency pricing with a reduced sales price of $9.99, the agency publishers are making the same amount of money as its hardcover revenue.
