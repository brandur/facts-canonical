Battle of the Teutoburg Forest
------------------------------

* AKA the Varian disaster.
* Took place in 9 CE, when an alliance of Germanic tribes led by Arminius of the Cherusci ambushed and decisively destroyed 3 Roman legions and their auxiliaries, led by Publius Quinctilius Varus.
* Despite numberous successful campaigns by the Roman army in the years later, they never again attempt to conquer Germania territory east of the Rhine River.
* The Roman line of march was perilously long -- estimates are that it surpassed 15 km, and may have been as long as 20 km.
* Rain prevented use of Roman bows as sinew strings become slack when wet, and their shields had also been waterlogged.
* After having their line attacked by Germanic warriors armed with light swords, large lances, and narrow-bladed short spears, the Romans were eventually able to set up fortified camp.
* Romans undertook a night march to escape, but marched into another trap set by Arminius at the foot of Kalkriese Hill. The sandy open strip that the Romans could march on easily was constricted by a hill so that there was only 100 m between the woods and swampland. The road was blocked by a trench, and an earthen wall had been built, allowing the Geramnic tribesmen to attack from cover.
* 15-20,000 Roman soldiers died, with minimal casualties on the Germanic side.
* Augustus exclaimed upon hearing of the defeat, "Quintilius Varus, give me back my legions!"
* The three legion numbers (17, 18, and 19) were not used again by the Romans.
* Arminius sent Varus' severed head to Maroboduus, the other most powerful Germanic ruler, with an offer of an anti-Roman alliance. Maroboduus declined, believing that Arminius meant to make himself king.
