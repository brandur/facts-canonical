Copyright

* Unlike authors, musicians don't own their own copyright. This is because the industry had music redefined as 'work for hire' under the Satellite Home Viewing Act of 1999.
* Toni Braxton declared bankruptcy in 1998 after selling $188M worth of CDs, because she was being paid less than 35 cents per album.
