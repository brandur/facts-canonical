Spartan Helots
--------------

* Originally free Greeks who the Spartans had defeated in battle and subsequently enslaed.
* Helots did not have voting rights, although compared to non-Greek chattel slaves in other parts of Greece, they were relatively privileged.
* Allowed to keep 50% of their income and to marry. Some accumulated enough wealth to buy their freedom.
* Each year when the Ephors took office they ritually declared war on the helots, allowing Spartans to kill them.
