Longitude Prize
---------------

* Reward offered by the British government for a simple and practical method for determing a ship's longitude.
* Established in 1714, and administered by the Board of Longitude.
* Determining latitude was relatively easy in that it could be established by observing the altitude of the sun. Longitude was hard and navigators often resorted to dead reckoning which was inaccurate on long voyages.
* Three major prizes at £10,000, £15,000, and £20,000 to be rewarded depending on the method's precision that were never claimed. The Board also had the discreation to award smaller prizes to persons making significant contributions to the problem.
* John Harrison received £15,000+ during his lifetime for his work with chronometers.
