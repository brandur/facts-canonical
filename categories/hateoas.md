HATEOAS
-------

* HATEOAS means Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State.
* Constraint of the REST application architecture where the client needs no prior knowledge about how to interact with any particular application beyond a generic understanding of hypermedia.
* Decouples client and server in a way that allows the server to evolve functionality independently.
* After a client enters a REST application, all future actions they may take are discovered within resource representations returned from the server. Media types and link relations are standardized.
* RESTful interaction is driven by hypermedia rather than out-of-band information.
