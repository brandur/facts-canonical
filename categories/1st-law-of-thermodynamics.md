1st Law of Thermodynamics
-------------------------

* _Energy can be neither created nor destroyed. It can only change forms._
* _In any process in an isolated system, the total energy remains the same._
* _For a thermodynamic cycle the net heat supplied to the system equals the net work done by the system_. i.e. when a system gets warmer, cooler, larger, or smaller, then it will have the same amount of energy each time it returns to a particular state.
