Bronze Age Collapse
-------------------

* Transition in the Aegean Region, Southwestern Asia, and the Eastern Mediterranean from the Late Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age ~1206-1150 BCE.
* Many historians believe that this was a violent, sudden, and culturally disruptive collapse.
* The palace economy of the Aegean Region which characterized the Late Bronze Age was replaced, after a hiatus, by the isolated village cultures of the Greek Dark Ages.
* Interrupted trade routes and severely reduced literacy, along with destroying almost every city between Pylos and Gaza.
* Possibly caused by climate changed resulting in crop failures for multiple consecutive years, which may have led to warfare as a last-ditch survival effort.
* The Hekla 3 eruption coincides approximately with the period and may have had a hand in the collapse.
