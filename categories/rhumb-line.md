Rhumb Line
----------

* In navigation, a line crossing all meridians of longitude at the same angle. This path can be derived from only an initial bearing, i.e. one proceeds along this bearing without changing direction as measured relative to true north.
* Over the Earth's surface at low latitudes and over short distances it can be used for plotting the course of a vehicle, aircraft, or ship. Over longer distances and/or higher latitudes, the great circle route is significantly shorter between the same two points.
* An East-West passage over 90 degrees of longitude at 20 degrees north of the equator would have a rhumb-line distance of 8,166 km, compared to the great-circle distance of 8,042 km. Only a 1.5% difference.
* An example demonstrating the breakdown of the rhumb-line compared to great-circle is New York to Hong Kong. The rhumb-line path is about 18,000 km, while the great-circle route over the North Pole is 13,000 km.
* "Rhumb" comes from the Spanish/Portuguese word _rumbo/rumo_ (course, direction).
