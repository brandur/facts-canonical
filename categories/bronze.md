Bronze
------

* Alloy consisting of copper, usually with tin as its main additive (modern bronze is 88% copper and 12% tin).
* Many historical pieces were made interchangeably with brasses (copper + zinc), so modern scholars often use the more inclusive term "copper alloy" instead.
* More durable than stone and copper predecessors.
* Earliest examples date to the late 4th millenium BC in Susa (Iran).
* Generally harder than wrought iron, the Bronze Age gave way to the Iron Age because iron was easier to find and process. Bronze was still used during the Iron Age. e.g. Officers in the Roman army had bronze swords while foot soliders had iron.
* Bronze is the preferred metal for top-quality bells, especially 23% tin (called bell metal).
