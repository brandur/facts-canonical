Positional Good
---------------

* Goods whose value is mostly a function of their ranking in desirability by others, in comparison to substitutes.
* Examples include high social status, exclusive real estate, a spot in the freshman class of a prestigious university, a reservation at the hottest new restaurant, and fame.
* Competitions for positional goods are zero-sum games because they are inherently scarce.
