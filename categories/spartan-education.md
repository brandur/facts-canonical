Spartan Education
-----------------

* When male Spartans began military training at age 7, they entered the _Agoge_ system, designed to encourage disciple and phyiscal toughness.
* Boys were fed just the right aount so as never to become sluggish being too full, while giving them a taste of what it is not to have enough.
* Besides physical and weapons training, boys stuided reading, writing, music, and dancing.
* Special punishments were imposed if boys failed to answer questions sufficiently 'laconicallly' (i.e. briefly and wittily).
