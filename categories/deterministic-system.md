Deterministic System
--------------------

* Conceptual model applied to a system for understanding everything that has and will occur in the system, based on the physical outcomes of causality. Every action, or cause, produces a reaction, or effect, and every reaction, it turn, becomes the cause of subsequent reactions. The totality of these cascading events can theoretically show exactly how the system will exist at any moment in time.
