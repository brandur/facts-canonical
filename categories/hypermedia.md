Hypermedia
----------

* Logical extension of the term hypertext in which graphis, audio, video, plain text, and hyperlinks intertwine to create a non-linear medium of information.
* The World Wide Web is an example of hypermedia, whereas a non-interactive cinema presentation is standard multimedia due to the absense of hyperlinks.
