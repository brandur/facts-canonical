Staysail
--------

* Rigged sail that can be affixed to stay running forward from mast to deck, the bowsprit, or another mast.
* Most are triangular, but some can be four-cornered, most notably some fisherman's staysails.
* Triangular staysails set forward to the foremost mast are called jibs, headsails, or foresails.
