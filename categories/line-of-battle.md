Line of Battle
--------------

* Tactic in which ships of a fleet form a line end to end.
* Advantageous over individual ship combat in that each ship in the line can fire without fear of hitting a friendly ship.
* Advantageous in that the relative movement of the line in relation to some part of the enemy fleet allows for a systematic concetration of fire. To fend off this possibility, the other fleet can also move in a line, making two fleets sailing along each other a typical sea battle since 1675.
* A ship powerful enough to stand in the line of battle became known as a "ship of the line" (of battle) or a "line of battle" ship, which shortened to become "battleship".
