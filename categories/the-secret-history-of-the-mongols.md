The Secret History of the Mongols
---------------------------------

* Oldest surviving Mongolian language literary work.
* Written sometime after Genghis Khan's death in AD 1227 for an anonymous author, and probably in the Uyghur script, though all surviving texts derive from transcriptions or translations into Chinese characters.
* Regarded as the single significant native Mongolian account of Genghis Khan.
* Like many texts from that period, contains elements of folklore and poetry that is not as factual as some historians would have wanted.
