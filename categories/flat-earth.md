Flat Earth
----------

* Most pre-modern cultures had a flat Earth conception, include ancient Greece until the classical period, the Bronze Age and Iron Age civilizations of the Ancient Near East until the Hellenistic period, Ancient India until the Gupta period (early centuries AD), and China until the 17th century.
* Spherical Earth paradigm developed in ancient Greek astronomy, beginning with Pythagoras (6th century BC), but didn't gain traction until Aristotle's acceptance of it based on empirical grounds ~330BC. Gradually spread to the rest of the Hellenistic world from then on.
* The misconception that educated people from the time in Columbus believed in a flat Earth is referred to as "The Myth of the Flat Earth", and is a very common historical error.
