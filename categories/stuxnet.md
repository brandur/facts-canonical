Stuxnet
-------

* First discovered work that spies on and reprograms industrial systems, specifically SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) systems and PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers).
* Attacks Windows first, and spreads to Siemens' WinCC SCADA software. Once inside a system, it uses default passwords to command the software.
* Includes four zero-day attacks for Windows.
* Represents many man-months and maybe man-years of work. Probably built by a team.
* Digitally signed with two authentic certificates which were stolen from authorities JMicron and Realtek.
* Can upgrade itself via peer to peer if the control server is disabled.
* There has been speculation that it was designed to target nuclear reactors in Iran.
