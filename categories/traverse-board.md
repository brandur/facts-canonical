Traverse Board
--------------

* A memory aid used in dead reckoning calculations usable by sailors that couldn't read or write.
* Using peg holes, a sailor could use it to make recordings of the headings and speeds sailed during every half-hour period of their watch. At the end of their watch, they would place the recordings in the log book and clear the board.
