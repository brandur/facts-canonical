Protagoras
----------

* Pre-Socratic Greek philosopher (490 BC - 420 BC) numbered as one of the sophists by Plato. In his dialogue _Protagoras_, Plato credits him with having invented the role of the professional sophist or teacher of virtue.
* His statement "man is the measure of all things" is beleived to have created a major controversy during ancient times. It claimed that the universe was based on something objective, outside the human influence.
* Born in Abdera Thrace, in Ancient Greece. Made his living as a porter, but was seen by the philosopher Democritus carrying a load of wood tied with a cord. Democritus discovered that the Protagoras had tied the load with such perfect geometric accuracy that it revealed him as a mathematic prodigy. He proceed to take Protagoras into his own household.
* Plutarch and Protagroas spent a whole day discussing legal responsibility. "In an athletic contest a man had been accidentally hit and killed with a javelin. Was his death to be attributed to the javelin itself, to the man who threw it, or to the authorities responsible for the games?"
* Especially interested in the question of whether virtue could be taught.
