Transact-SQL
------------

* Extends SQL with flow control: `BEGIN` and `END`, `BREAK`, `CONTINUE`, `GOTO`, `IF` and `ELSE`, `RETURN`, `WAITFOR`, and `WHILE`.
* Extends SQL: `DELETE` and `UPDATE` statements both allow a `FROM` clause to be added, which allows joins to be included.
* Extends SQL: `BULK INSERT` from multiple row definitions or a file for better performance.
