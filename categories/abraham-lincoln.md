Abraham Lincoln
---------------

* The 16th President of the United States.
* Successfully led the US through its greatest constitutional, military, and moral crisis -- the American Civil War -- preserving the Union while ending slavery, and promoting economic and financial modernization.
* Reared in a poor family on the western frontier, Lincoln was mostly self-educated.
* Had almost no support in the South, but swept the North and was elected president in 1860.
* His election was the signal for seven southern slave states to declare their secession from the Union and form the Confederate States of America.
* Exercised his authority to suspend _habeas corpus_ and arrested and detained thousands of suspected secessionists.
* Prevented British recognition of the Confederacy by skillfully handling the _Trent_ affair late in 1861.
* Issued his Emancipation Proclamation, encouraging the border states to outlaw slavery, and helped push the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution through Congress, which finally ended all slavery in 1865.
* His Gettysburg Address of 1863 became the most quoted speech in American history. It was an iconomic statement of America's dedication to nationalism, republicanism, equal rights, liberty, and democracy. 
* Six days after the surrender of Confederate commanding general Robert E. Lee, Lincoln was assassinated by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth. It was the first assassination of a US president.
