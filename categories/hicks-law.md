Hick's Law
----------

* Describes the time taken for a person to make a decision as a result of the possible choices he or she has; that is, increasing the number of choices will increase decision time logarithmically.
* Logarithmic because people subdivide the total collection into categories, eliminating about half the remaining choices with each step, rather than considering choices one-by-one.
* Given \( n \) choices, the time to choose among them is approximately: \( T = b . log_2(n + 1) \).
