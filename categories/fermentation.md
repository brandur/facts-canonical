Fermentation
------------

* The catalyst function that turns grape juice into an alcoholic beverage.
* Yeast interact with sugars in the juice to create ethanol (or ethyl alcohol), and carbon dioxide (a by-product).
* Temperature, speed, and levels of oxygen present are important considerations.
* Carried out in stainless steel tanks (common with many white wines like Riesling), in an open wooden vat, inside a wine barrel, or inside a wine bottle itself (many sparkling wines).
* In the mid-19th century, Louis Pasteur noted the connection between yeast and the process of fermentation in which the yeast act as a catalyst and mediator in the series of reactions converting sugar into alcohol.
* Discovery of the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway by Gustav Embden, Otto Fritz Meyerhof, and Jakub Karol Parnas in the early 20th century contributed more to the understanding of the complex chemical processes involved in the conversion of sugar to alcohol.
