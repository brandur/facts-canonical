A Moveable Feast
----------------

* Memories of Ernest Hemingway about his years in Paris as part of expatriate circle of writers in the 1920s.
* Not published during Hemingway's life, but published by his widow and 4th wife, Mary, and republished by his grandson Sean Hemingway.
* "If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris a young man, then wherever you go the rest of your life, it stays with you, for Paris a moveable feast."
* In 1956, Hemingway recovered two small steamer trunks that he'd stored in the 1928 in the basement of the Ritz Hotel in Paris. They contained notebooks he'd filled while in Paris, and he had them transcribed.
