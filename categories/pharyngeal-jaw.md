Pharyngeal Jaw
--------------

* Second sets of jaws contained within an animal's throat, seen in ~30,000 species of fishes.
* Believed to have originated as modified gill arches.
* Most notable example in the moray eel. It does not swallow by creating negative pressure in the mouth like other fishes, so it bites first with its oral jaws, capturing the prey, then the pharyngeal jaws come forward, grip the prey, and pull it into the eel's gullet where it is swallowed.
