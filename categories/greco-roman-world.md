Greco-Roman World
-----------------

* Refers to those geographical regions and countries that culturally were influenced by the language, culture, government and religion of the ancient Greeks and Romans.
* Refers to the Mediterranean world, the tracts of land centered on the Mediterranean and Black Sea basins including Greece, Cyprus, Italy, the Iberian Peninsula, Asia Minor, Syria, Egypt, and Africa Proper (Tunisia and Libya).
* There is evidence of mutal knowledge between Greeks and Romans, for example, several hundred papyrus volumes found in a Roman villa at Herculaneum are in Greek. Romand frequented schools in Greece.
* Architecture is abundant in columns and size. Two primary types are Doric (example, the Parthenon) and Ionic (more decorative than formal).
* Romans made it possible for subject-peoples to acquire Romand citizenship, and would sometimes confer it on whole communities; thus, "Roman" became less of an ethnic and more of a political designation.
* Greek was the language of intellectual culture and Eastern commerce, and Latin of public management and forensic advocacy, especially in the West. Rural peasants (the great majority of the population) never adopted these as their native idiom, but all men of note and accomplishment spoke one or both.
