Sword of Damocles
-----------------

* Damocles was a courtier in the court of Dionysius II of Syracuse, a fourth century BC tyrant of Syracuse, Italy. Pandering to his king, Damocles exclaimed that he was truly fortunate to be surrounded by such magnificence. Dionysius offered to switch places so that he could experience it firsthand. Damocles sat down in the throne surrounded by every luxury, but Dionysius arranged that a huge sword should hang above the throne, held at the tip only by a single hair of a horse's tail. Damocles finally begged the tyrant that he be allowed to depart.
* Morals: (1) Heavy hangs the head that wears the crown. (2) The value of the sword is not that it falls, but rather, that it hangs. This last moral is very applicable to the theory of MAD.
* John F. Kennedy compared the omnipresent threat of nuclear annihilation to a sword of Damocles hanging over the people of the world.
