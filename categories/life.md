* **CHNOPS** &mdash; life on earth uses six elements heavy in its chemistry: carbon, hydrogen, osxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur (CHNOPS). These elements are very close to each other in the periodic table.
* Life uses significant quantities of some ions: sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride, for osmotic balance, but they also play a role in nervous system function and regulation.
