Dead Reckoning
--------------

* Process of calculating one's position by using a previously determined position based on known or estimated speeds over elapsed time, and course.
* Subject to cumulative errors.
* There is speculation on the etymological origin of the term, but no reliable information.
* Before the 19th-century development of the marine chronometer and the lunar distance method, dead reckoning was the primary method of determining longitude available to mariners. Tools like the Traverse board were developed to enable even illiterate crew members to collect required data.
