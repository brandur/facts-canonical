Binary Search Tree
------------------

* Average time complexity: space `O(n)`, search `O(log n)`, insert `O(log n)`, delete `O(log n)`. Worst case time complexity: Space `O(n)`, search `O(n)`, insert `O(n)`, delete `O(n)`.
* Properties: (1) the left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key, (2) the right subtree has only nodes greater, (3) both left and right subtrees are also binary search trees.
* Major advantage is that sorting algorithms, search algorithms, and in-order traversal can be very efficient.
* Fundamental data structure used to construct more abstract data structures such as sets, multisets, and associative arrays.
* Out of binary search trees, treaps have been found to have the best average performance, while red-black trees have the smallest performance fluctuation.
