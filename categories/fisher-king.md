Fisher King
-----------

* Also known as the **Wounded King** is according to Aurthurian legend the last in lind charged with keeping the Holy Grail.
* The story varies, but he is always wounded in the legs or groin, and incapable of moving on his own, so there is little for him to do but fish in the river near his castle Corbenic.
* Knights travel from many lands to heal the Fisher King, but only the chosen can accomplish the feat.
* Theme is used in the Hemingway novel _The Sun Also Rises_ in which a WWI veteran, who has suffered war wounds in the groin, is unable to perform sexually and finds balance in his life by going fishing.
* A game in _The Wheel of Time_ includes a central piece called "the Fisher", in the shape of an old, blinded, and wounded man whose emotions are tied to the land.
