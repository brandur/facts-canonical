Dean Drive
----------

* Claimed reactionless thruster claimed to generate unidirectional force in violation of Newton's 3rd Law of Motion invented by Norman L. Dean.
* Several demonstrations were made, but no independent 3rd party study was ever permitted.
* Dean received two patents for related devices.
* Claims were subsequently shown to be in error as the device was reliant on the friction of the surface on which it was resting.
