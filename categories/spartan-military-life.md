Spartan Military Life
---------------------

* At age 20, the Spartan citizen began membership in one of the _syssitia_ (dining messes or clubs), composed of 15 members each. Everyone was required to be a member, and each group learned how to bond and rely on one another.
* Only native Spartans were considered full citizens and were obliged to undergo training.
* Spartans were not eligible for public office until age 30.
* Men were encouraged to marry at 20, but could not be with their families until leaving active military service at age 30. They remained in active reserve until age 60.
* Thucydides reports that when a Spartan man went to war, his wife (or a woman of significance) would customarily present him with his shield and say: "With this, or upon this."
* It was less of a disgrace for a solider to lose his helmet, breastplate, or graves than his shield, because the shield protected the man and the man to his left. Therefore sybolic to the solider's subordindation to his unit
* Aristotle believe Spartan military culture to be short-sighted and ineffective because they were too focused on only a single aspect of life.
