Olympic Games
-------------

* More than 200 nations encompassing 13,000 atheletes compete in 33 sports and ~400 events.
* Originally held in Olympia, Greece from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD.
* In 1894 the International Olympic Committee (IOC) was founded by Pierre de Coubertin, who have become the governing body of the Olympic Movement, whose actions are defined by the Olympic Charter.
* The first Games held under the IOC was in Athens in 1896 in which 14 nations and 241 athletes competed.
* Coubertin originally imagined amateur contenders competing, but this was phased out beginning in the 1970s. It was considered that a gentleman was one who became an all-rounder, not the best at one specific thing.
* In 1912, Jim Thorpe was stripped of his medals when it was discovered that he played semi-professional baseball before the Olympis. They were later restored posthumously.
* After 1988, the IOC decided to make all professionals eligible. As of 2004, the only sports in which no professionals compete are boxing and wrestling, and men's football teams are restricted to only 3 professional players over the age of 23.
* World Wars led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Games. Boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Games.
* Most costly games have been London 2012 (USD14.8B), Barcelona 1992 (USD11.4B), and Montreal 1976 (USD6B). Beijing 2008's numbers are unknown.
* Olympics overrun budget with 100% consistency. Largest have been Montreal 1976 (796%) and Barcelona 1992 (417%).
* The Olympic rings represent the unity of the five inhabited continents. Colors were chosen because every nation had at least one of them on its national flag. Flag adopted in 1914.
* Olympic motto is _Citius, Altius, Fortius_, meaning "Faster, Higher, Stronger".
