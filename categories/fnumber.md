F-number
--------

* In optics, the f-number (or focal ratio, f-ratio, f-stop, or relative aperture) expresses the diameter of the entrance pupil in terms of the focal length of the lens.
* \( N = f/D \) where  \( f \) is the focal length, and \( D \) is the diameter of the entrance pupil (dimensionless).
