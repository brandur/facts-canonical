* Hypothetical megastructure proposed by Robert Bradbury, based on the Dyson sphere, of immense computational capacity.
* Example of a Class B stellar engine, employing the entire energy output of a star to drive a computation system.
* Composed of at least two (but typically more) Dyson spheres around a star, nested within each other. Each shell would absorb all incoming energy, utilize it for computation, and radiate it outward to be caught by the next layer.
