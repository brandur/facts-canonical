Iron Pillar of Delhi
--------------------

* 7 m column in Delhi, notable for the rust-resistant composition of the metals used in its construction.
* Corrosion resistance results from an even layer of crystalline iron hydrogen phosphate forming on the high phosophorus content iron.
* Fence erected around it in 1997 due to damage caused by visitors. It was considered good luck if one could stand with one's back to the pillar and make one's hands meet behind it -- this led to significant discoloration on the lower portion of the pillar.
~ ~1600 years old.
