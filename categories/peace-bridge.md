Peace Bridge
------------

* Pedestrian and cycling bridge designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava.
* Supposed to open in fall 2010. Opened in March 2012.
* No piers in the water to minimize ecological footprint.
* Built to withstand Calgary's one-in-100 year flood cycle.
* Cost ~$25M.
* Bridge was manufactured in Spain and shipped to Calgary. Assembly of the bridge occurred in pieces.
* During weld inspection, it was discovered that some of the Spanish welds did not comply with quality standards. This significantly delayed the bridge's opening.
