Americano
---------

* Coffee prepared by adding hot water to espresso. A single or double-shot of espresso combined with 30 - 470 mL (1 - 16 oz) of water.
* In the US, may refer to combining water and espresso in either order, but in a narrower definition it refers to water _to_ espresso, the reverse being known as a long black.
* Name derives its origins from WW2 when American GIs would pour hot water into espresso to approximate the coffee to which they were accustomed.
