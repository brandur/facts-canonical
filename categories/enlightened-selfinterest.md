Enlightened Self-interest
-------------------------

* Philosophy in ethics which states that persons who act to further the interests of others (or the interests of the group or groups to which they belong) ultimately serve their own self-interest.
* Often simplified that an individual, group, or commercial entity will _do well by doing good_.
