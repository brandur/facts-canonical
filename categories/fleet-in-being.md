Fleet in Being
--------------

* Naval force that extends a controlling influence without ever leaving port. While in port, an emey must continually deploy forces to guard against it.
* Term first used in 1690 by Lord Torrington, commander of the Royal Navy, who suggested avoiding sea battle with the French fleet except under very favorable conditions.
