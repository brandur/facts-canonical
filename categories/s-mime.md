S/MIME
------

* Standard for public key encryption and signing of MIME data.
* On an IETF standards track.
* Originally developed by RSA Data Security Inc.
* Used the PKCS#7 secure message format, but the specification has since been layered on Crytographic Message Syntax, an IETF specification that is identical in most respects to PKCS#7.
* S/MIME is built into the majority of modern email software, and interoperates between them.
* Implementation via webmail clients still presents major challenges.
