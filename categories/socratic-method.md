Socratic Method
---------------

* Named after the classical Greek philosopher Socrates, is a form of inquiry and debate between individuals with opposing viewpoints based on asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking and illuminate ideas.
* Defense of one view is pitted against the defense of another; one participant may lead to contradict himself and strengthen the inquirer's point.
* _Negative_ method for hypothesis elimination in which better hypotheses are found by eliminating those that lead to contradictions.
* Socrates began to engage in such discussions with his fellow Athenians after his friend from youth, Chaerephon, visited the Oracle of Delphi, which confirmed that no man in Greece was wiser than Socrates. Socrates saw this as a paradox, and began using the Socratic method to answer his conundrum.
* Plato famously formalized it in prose--presenting Socrates as the curious questioner of some prominent Athenian interlocutor, for example in _Euthyphro_ and _Ion_. Known as "Socratic dialogues."
* Steps: 1. interlocutor asserts a thesis, e.g. "Courage is endurance of the soul", which Socrates considers false. 2. Socrates secures his interlocutor's agreement to further premises, e.g. "Courage is a fine thing" and "Ignorant endurance is not a fine thing." 3. Socrates argues and the interlocutor agrees that these premises imply the contrary of the original thesis. 4. Socrates claims that he has shown that the thesis is false.
