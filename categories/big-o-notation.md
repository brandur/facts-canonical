Big O Notation
--------------

* Used to describe the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity, usually in terms of simpler functions.
* Usually only describes an upper bound on the growth rate of a function. Several other related notations describe other kinds of bounds on asymptotic growth rates: o, Ω, ω, and Θ.
* Rules: (1) if f(x) is the sum of several terms, the one with the largest growth rate is kept, and all others are omitted; and (2) if f(x) is a product of several factors, any constants are omitted.
* Ignoring lower order terms and coefficients has a negligible effect on the expression's value for most purposes.
* Number of steps in an algorithm varies between machine types, but only by a constant factor, keeping a Big O approximation accurate.
