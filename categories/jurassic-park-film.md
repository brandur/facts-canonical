Jurassic Park (Film)
--------------------

* Crichton was hired for $500k to adapt the novel. David Koepp wrote the final draft, which left out much of the exposition and violence.
* After publishing the book, Crichton demanded a $1.5M fee for the rights as well as a substantial piece of the gross.
* Filmed in Hawaii (Kaua'i, Oahu, and Niihau) and California.
* Grossed $900M worldwide (budget $63M) during its release, becoming the highest grossing film up to that time; surpassing ET and later surpassed by Titanic.
* George Lucas teared up after watching the initial draft of the computer generated scene of the _T. rex_ chasing a heard of Gallimumus, comparing it to the invention of the light bulb.
* The depicted _Velociraptors_ were actually the larger genus _Deinonychus_. The paleontological community had originally started using this synonym, but later dropped it.
