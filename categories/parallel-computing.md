Parallel Computing
------------------

* Form of computation in which many calculations are carried out simultaneously, operating on the principle that large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which are then solved concurrently.
* Several forms: (1) bit-level (increase processor word size), (2) instruction level, (3) data, and (4) task parallelism.
