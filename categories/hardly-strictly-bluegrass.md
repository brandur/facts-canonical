Hardly Strictly Bluegrass
-------------------------

* Annual non-commercial event held in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park since 2001.
* Conceived and subsidized by San Francisco venture capitalist Warren Hellman; who also sponsored for the event for at least 15 years past his death.
* Originally "Strictly Bluegrass", the word "Hardly" was added in 2004 to reflect its expanded scope as non-bluegrass musicians were invited.
