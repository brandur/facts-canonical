Coffee
------

* A coffee bean is the seed of the coffee plant (the pit inside the red or purple fruit referred to as a cherry). Despite being seeds, they are often called beans because of their resemblance to true beans.
* Fruits (coffee cherries or coffee berries) most commonly contain 2 stones with their flat sides together. A fruit with 1 seed is called a **peaberry**.
* Like brazil nuts and white rice, coffee beans consist mostly of endosperm.
* Important varieties are Arabica: 75-80% of coffee produced worldwide and 0.8-1.4% caffeine, and Robusta: 20% and 1.7-4% caffeine.
* US imports more coffee than any other nation, with the average person consuming 4.09 kg per year.
* Cultivation began in Yemen in ~850 CE. Spread to the rest of Arabia and mentioned in writing ~900 CE. The Yemenites guarded it carefully, but plants were eventually smuggled out to the Dutch. Introduced in Americas ~1723.
* South America responsible for ~45% of total coffee exports.
* Plant averages 5-10 m in height. As it gets older, it branches less and bears more leaves and fruits. Fruit appears at 3-4 years of age, and is produced for 10-20 more years.
* Ripe fruit is almost always handpicked. A tree can have ripe and unripe berries at the same time, so one area of the crop may have to be harvested several times, making harvesting the most labor intensive process of bean production.
* **Wet processing:** flesh of berries is separated, and the beans are soaked in water for ~2 days to remove pulp and residue. Beans are then washed and dried in the sun or with drying machines. Used in Central America and areas in Africa.
* **Dry processing:** twigs and cruft are separated from berries and the fruit is spread out in the sun on cement or brick for 2-3 weeks (turned regularly). Dried pulp is removed from beans afterwards. Cheaper and simpler, used for lower quality beans in Brazil and most of Africa.
* After processing, husks are removed froom beans and roasted, which gives them their brown color.
