Roman Legion
------------

* Organization varied voer time, but typically composed of 6,000 soldiers.
* Originally divided into maniples (2 century), and later into cohorts (6 century). Centuries were ~100 men.
* Each legion always included a small cavalry attachment.
* Joining the army was a distinguishing mark or Roman citizenship; pre-Marian the wealthiest land owners performed the most military service, they would have the most to lose should the state fall.
* The wealthiest common class was armed with spear, sword, helmet, breast plate, and round shield (_clipeus_ or _hoplon_). The fourth class could afford no armour, and beared perhaps a small shield and a spear.
* During Caesar's exploits in Gaul, his legions had been reduced to closer to 3,500 soldiers.
