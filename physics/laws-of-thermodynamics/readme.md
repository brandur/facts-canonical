Laws of thermodynamics
======================

** **DO NOT UPDATE CONTENT BELOW THIS LINE** **

0th law
-------

* Zeroth law: _If two thermodynamic systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third, then they are in thermal equilibrium with each other_ (an **equivalence** relation).
* When two systems, each in its own thermodynamic equilibrium, are put in a purely thermal connection with each other, there will be a net exchange of heat between them until they are in thermal equilibrium.

1st law
-------

* _Energy can be neither created nor destroyed. It can only change forms._
* _In any process in an isolated system, the total energy remains the same._
* _For a thermodynamic cycle the net heat supplied to the system equals the net work done by the system_. i.e. when a system gets warmer, cooler, larger, or smaller, then it will have the same amount of energy each time it returns to a particular state.

2nd law
-------

* _Spontaneous natural processes increase entropy overall_.

3rd law
-------

* _As temperature approaches absolute zero, the entropy of a system approaches a constant minimum_.
