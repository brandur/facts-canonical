0th law
=======

* Zeroth law: _If two thermodynamic systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third, then they are in thermal equilibrium with each other_ (an **equivalence** relation).
* When two systems, each in its own thermodynamic equilibrium, are put in a purely thermal connection with each other, there will be a net exchange of heat between them until they are in thermal equilibrium.
