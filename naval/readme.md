Bow Wave
--------

* Wave that forms at the bow of a ship when moving through water. As the bow wave spreads out, it defines the outer limits of a ship's wake.
* A large bow wave slows a ship down, poses a risk to smaller boats, and in a harbor can cause damage to moored ships and shore facilities, so ship hulls are generally designed to produce the smallest bow wave possible.
* A bow wave forms at the head of a swimmer. The trough of this wave lies near the mouth of the swimmer and helps him inhale air to breathe just by turning his head.
